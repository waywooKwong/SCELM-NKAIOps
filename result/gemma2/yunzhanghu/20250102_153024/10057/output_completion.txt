	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "36.getBackupEmp success, 28.AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, 1.message , 4.computeOwnObjectIDs end, 37.computeOwnObjectIDs end  ",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from normal patterns after the change. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit increased variance, while 'message' shows a shift in mean value. Additionally, several other KPIs like 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' have anomalous data points.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the changes implemented recently and identify potential areas affecting these KPIs. 2. Analyze logs and system metrics related to the affected components (e.g., authentication, backup processes) to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. 3. Consider reverting or adjusting the recent changes if they appear to be directly responsible for the deviations. 4. Implement monitoring strategies to track these KPIs more closely and detect future anomalies promptly."
