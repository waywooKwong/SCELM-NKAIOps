{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message,getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations from normal patterns. Several KPIs, such as 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', exhibit increased negative values and reduced ranges, indicating potential service disruptions or data processing issues. Additionally, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' shows a widened range, suggesting instability.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPIs. This could involve examining logs, monitoring system resources, and checking for any recent configuration changes. 2. Analyze the increased range in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to identify potential performance bottlenecks or resource constraints. Consider optimizing code or adjusting resource allocation. 3. Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies in real-time and trigger timely interventions."
