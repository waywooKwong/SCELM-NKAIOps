	"reason": "The data indicates several KPIs have deviated significantly from their expected behavior. Notably, 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a sharp decrease in its mean value, suggesting potential issues with MySQL interactions. The rate of build failures has also increased, as evidenced by the elevated value of 'irate(build[1m])'. Additionally,  'parseRegoError', 'resolve Rego', and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' display concerning anomalies, hinting at problems within the Rego parsing, resolution, and hierarchical data handling processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the MySQL connection issues affecting 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success'. Analyze build logs to identify the root causes of increased build failures. Review the Rego codebase for potential syntax errors or logical flaws contributing to 'parseRegoError' and 'resolve Rego' anomalies. Examine data structures related to hierarchy ('superiorAndDeputy empty') to pinpoint inconsistencies or missing information."
