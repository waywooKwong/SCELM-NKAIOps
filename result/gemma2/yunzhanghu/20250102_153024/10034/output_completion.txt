	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeDeptObjectIDs end ",
	"reason": "The data indicates several key performance indicators (KPIs) have exhibited significant deviations from expected behavior. This suggests underlying system issues or potential resource constraints impacting these critical functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the getBackupEmp success KPI:** Analyze backup logs and database activity to identify any errors or performance bottlenecks during backups.  2. **Review AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> behavior:** Examine authentication processes and user access patterns for anomalies. Check log files for errors related to Chinese information retrieval. 3. **Analyze the message KPI:** Investigate the source of these messages, particularly if they indicate errors or warnings. Check application logs and system events for clues about the cause. 4. **Monitor computeOwnObjectIDs end and computeDeptObjectIDs end:**  Review object storage performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) to identify potential bottlenecks. Optimize object retrieval strategies if necessary. 5. **Resource Monitoring:** Ensure adequate CPU, memory, and network resources are allocated to the affected systems. Use monitoring tools to track resource utilization and identify potential constraints."
