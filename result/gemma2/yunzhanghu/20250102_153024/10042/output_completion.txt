	"reason": "The analyzed data shows several KPIs exhibiting significant deviations from their expected ranges. This suggests potential performance bottlenecks or system issues.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the top 5 abnormal KPIs**: Delve deeper into the metrics of 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'sum(duration) by (service)' to pinpoint the exact cause of their anomalies. \n2. **Monitor system resources**: Keep a close eye on CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and disk I/O during periods when these KPIs are performing poorly.\n3. **Review logs**: Examine system logs for error messages or unusual activity that might correlate with the observed anomalies.\n4. **Consider code review**: If necessary, analyze the relevant code segments to identify potential performance issues or bugs."
