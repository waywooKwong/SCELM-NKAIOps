	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_memory_rss, approve status error, superiorAndDeputy, container_memory_rss, get trace info",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations from normal behavior. Several KPIs, including `container_memory_rss`,  `approve status error`, and `superiorAndDeputy`,  exhibit unusually high or low values. This suggests potential resource contention, process errors, or configuration issues.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of elevated memory consumption (`container_memory_rss`). Analyze application resource usage, identify memory leaks, and optimize code for efficiency. \n2. Examine the `approve status error` metrics to pinpoint the source of these errors. Review logs and system configurations related to approval processes.\n3. Investigate the unusual behavior of `superiorAndDeputy`. Analyze the logic and dependencies involved in this process to identify potential bottlenecks or inconsistencies."
