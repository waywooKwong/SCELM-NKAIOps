	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "The top 5 abnormal KPIs are: sum(objectIDs) , getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  message.",
	"reason": "The data analysis indicates several KPIs have shifted significantly outside their expected ranges. This suggests potential issues in various system components, including object ID management, authentication processes, and message handling. The deviation from normal patterns raises concerns about service stability and performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the `sum(objectIDs)` KPI**: Analyze the factors contributing to the significant change in object IDs. Check for data integrity issues, potential duplicates, or anomalies in object creation/deletion processes. 2. **Review the `getBackupEmp success` KPI**: Examine the backup procedures and logs for errors or failures. Investigate any recent changes related to employee data management that might be impacting this KPI. 3. **Analyze the `AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>` KPI**:  Identify any changes in authentication logic, user roles, or permissions that could explain the shift in this metric. Ensure proper authorization mechanisms are in place and functioning correctly. 4. **Scrutinize the `computeOwnObjectIDs end` KPI**: Investigate potential bottlenecks or performance issues within the object ID management system. Review code for inefficiencies or resource contention. 5. **Monitor the `message` KPI**: Analyze message queues, logging systems, and communication channels to identify any errors, delays, or unusual message patterns. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect anomalies in real-time."
