	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(duration) by (status)",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from expected behavior. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs' show reduced performance with higher mean values post-change. 'message' shows a shift in trend from upward to downward. This indicates potential issues with data processing, retrieval, or authorization logic.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate code changes:** Review recent modifications for potential regressions impacting these KPIs. 2. **Monitor logs:** Analyze application and system logs for errors or warnings correlated with the affected KPIs. 3. **Stress test:**  Perform load testing to identify performance bottlenecks under increased workload. 4. **Database optimization:** Ensure efficient querying and indexing strategies for data retrieval operations."
