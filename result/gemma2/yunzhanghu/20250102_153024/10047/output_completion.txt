	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant increase in metrics such as `sum(bytes)`, `sum(requests)`, and `avg(latency)`, while `count(exceptions)` and `error_rate` also show concerning trends. This suggests a potential performance degradation or overload issue.",
	"solution": "Investigate the underlying causes for the increased load on the system.  This could involve analyzing application logs, monitoring resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk), and identifying any bottlenecks in the code or infrastructure."
