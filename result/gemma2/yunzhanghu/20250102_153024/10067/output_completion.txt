	"reason": "The data inspection reveals that several key performance indicators (KPIs) have experienced significant deviations from their expected ranges. Notably, 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' has shifted to a consistent 0.0 mean and range, indicating potential issues with data loading or retrieval. Additionally, KPIs like 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'superiorAndDeputy empty', and 'approve status error' show notable changes in their distributions, suggesting problems in specific workflows or data processing steps. The KPI 'build <:*:> [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>  also exhibits a substantial shift in its distribution, implying potential issues within the building process.",
	"solution": "A comprehensive investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This should include analyzing logs, monitoring system resource utilization, and examining relevant code for potential errors or bottlenecks. Addressing the 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' issue might involve reviewing database connections, query performance, or data integrity. For KPIs showing changes in distribution, scrutinizing the associated workflows and data processing pipelines is crucial to identify problematic steps. Additionally, implementing robust monitoring and alerting systems can help detect future anomalies promptly."
