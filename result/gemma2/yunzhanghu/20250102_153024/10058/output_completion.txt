	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their normal ranges.  The 'sum(value) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' KPI shows a notable increase in value, while 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  decreases. Additionally, 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' also show unusual patterns, indicating potential issues within those systems or processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'sum(value) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' KPI increase**: Analyze resource consumption patterns for pods in relevant namespaces on nodes to identify potential bottlenecks or performance degradation. 2. **Review logs and configuration for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**:  Examine authentication processes and system logs for errors or inconsistencies that might explain the decrease in this metric. 3. **Monitor 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' closely**: Track their performance over time and look for recurring patterns or events coinciding with anomalies. Consider implementing alerting systems to notify you of significant deviations."
