{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(requests)",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals a significant deviation in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the recent change. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>',  'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'sum(requests)' are exhibiting abnormal trends. This suggests that the implemented changes might have introduced unforeseen issues impacting these specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced recently to pinpoint the potential source of the anomalies in the affected KPIs. 2. **Monitor affected systems:** Continuously monitor the performance of the systems and applications impacted by the change, paying close attention to resource utilization, error rates, and latency. 3. **Roll back changes (if possible):** If the impact is severe, consider rolling back the recent changes to a stable state while further investigating the root cause. 4. **Test thoroughly:** Implement rigorous testing procedures to ensure that future changes are thoroughly evaluated before deployment."
