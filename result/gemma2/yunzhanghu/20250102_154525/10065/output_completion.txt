	"reason": "The analysis of the provided metrics reveals several anomalies indicative of system performance degradation. Notably, high CPU and memory usage rates, low HTTP request throughput, and elevated latency for both Redis and MySQL queries suggest potential resource constraints or bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "To address these issues, consider the following:\n- Investigate resource consumption patterns and identify processes consuming excessive CPU or memory.\n- Optimize application code to reduce resource demands and improve efficiency.\n- Increase hardware resources such as CPU cores, RAM, or network bandwidth if necessary.\n- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database query load and latency.\n- Monitor system performance metrics continuously and proactively adjust configurations based on observed trends."
