	"reason": "The observed data indicates a significant deviation from expected behavior. Multiple KPIs exhibit anomalies, suggesting underlying system issues or configuration problems. The specific anomalies suggest potential performance bottlenecks or resource constraints in certain operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the anomalous KPIs:** Dive deeper into the data for each flagged KPI to pinpoint the exact nature of the issue. Examine logs, resource utilization metrics, and code execution traces. \n2. **Review recent changes:** Analyze any recent deployments, configuration updates, or code modifications that might have introduced these anomalies.  \n3. **Monitor system resources:** Keep a close eye on CPU usage, memory consumption, network bandwidth, and disk I/O to identify potential resource contention issues. \n4. **Optimize performance bottlenecks:** Based on the identified issues, implement performance optimizations such as code refactoring, query tuning, or hardware upgrades.\n5. **Rollback recent changes:** If a specific change is suspected to be the root cause, consider reverting it and assessing the impact."
