{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,  message, sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total),sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes) ",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit significant deviations from their expected behavior. This includes a decrease in 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' , while 'message' shows an increase in error rates. Additionally, container resource utilization metrics like 'sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total)' and 'sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes)' have spiked.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the decreased success rate for 'getBackupEmp' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' operations. This could involve examining logs, tracing request flows, and checking for potential bottlenecks or errors. 2. Analyze the increased error rates in the 'message' KPI to identify problematic communication patterns or data inconsistencies. 3. Monitor and optimize container resource consumption by adjusting resource limits, scheduling strategies, and application configurations. 4. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect anomalies and trigger timely interventions."
