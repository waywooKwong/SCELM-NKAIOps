	"reason": "The system is experiencing performance degradation and potential data anomalies. Several KPIs have shown significant deviations from their expected ranges, indicating underlying issues. Specifically, computeOwnObjectIDs end,getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,message and sum_of_bytes_sent are showing anomalous behavior, suggesting problems with data processing, retrieval, and network communication.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This may involve examining logs, system resource utilization, and database performance.  Potential solutions could include optimizing query performance, addressing resource contention issues, or investigating potential network bottlenecks."
