	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(bytes)",
	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal patterns. Several KPIs, particularly AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and message, exhibit sharp increases or decreases in values, suggesting potential performance issues, errors, or data anomalies.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>**: Analyze the increase in this KPI to identify the root cause. Check for excessive API calls or database queries related to Chinese information retrieval.\n2. **Review getBackupEmp success**:  Analyze the decrease in success rate. Examine backup logs and system resources to pinpoint potential failures during the backup process.\n3. **Examine computeOwnObjectIDs end**: The change in this KPI suggests issues with object identification processes. Investigate resource contention, database performance, or code logic related to object retrieval.\n4. **Monitor message KPIs**:  The significant increase/decrease in message-related metrics could indicate network bottlenecks, application errors, or unexpected message volumes. Analyze logs and system performance to identify the source of this change.\n5. **Resource Monitoring**: Perform a comprehensive resource analysis (CPU, memory, disk) to detect potential bottlenecks that might be contributing to these anomalies."
