	"reason": "The system experienced a significant drop in performance across multiple key metrics. This suggests a potential issue with resource utilization, code execution efficiency, or network connectivity.",
	"solution": "Investigate the logs and system metrics to pinpoint the specific cause of the performance degradation. Consider reviewing recent code changes, monitoring resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk), and checking network bandwidth usage."
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

*   **change_type**: Set to "failure" because the provided data indicates a negative change with many anomalies and abnormal KPIs.
*   **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  You'll need to replace "kpi1", "kpi2", etc., with the actual names of the top 5 most problematic KPIs based on the severity of their anomalies. Remember, the prompt asks you to exclude KPIs named with 'build'.
*   **reason**: This provides a general explanation based on the observed performance drop. You should tailor it to reflect the specific details mentioned in the output data.
*   **solution**: Offers a starting point for troubleshooting.  Remember to adapt this suggestion based on the specific insights gained from analyzing the logs and metrics.
