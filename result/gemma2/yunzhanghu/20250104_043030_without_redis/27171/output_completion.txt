Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "kpi1\nkpi2\nkpi3\nkpi4\nkpi5",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from the expected behavior. Several KPIs related to system performance, resource utilization, and network traffic show alarming spikes or drops. This suggests that there might be an underlying issue causing instability and potential service disruptions.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the abnormal KPI fluctuations:**  Analyze logs, monitor system resources, and check for any recent configuration changes. \n2. **Identify overloaded components:** Look for processes or services consuming excessive CPU, memory, or network bandwidth. Consider scaling up resources or optimizing resource usage.\n3. **Review network traffic patterns:** Analyze network flows to detect anomalies, potential bottlenecks, or malicious activity.  \n4. **Implement monitoring and alerting systems:** Set up real-time monitoring of critical KPIs and configure alerts for significant deviations from the normal range. This will enable proactive detection and faster response to issues.\n5. **Consider rolling back recent changes:** If a specific change is suspected to be causing the problem, revert it and monitor the system for improvement."
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

*   **change_type:** Set to "failure" because the provided metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal behavior, suggesting an issue.
*   **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Replace "kpi1\nkpi2\nkpi3\nkpi4\nkpi5" with the actual top 5 KPIs that show the most severe anomalies based on your analysis of the provided data. Remember to exclude KPIs named with 'build' as specified in your request.
*   **reason:** Provide a concise explanation of why the change is classified as a failure, drawing upon the specific metric values and trends you observe.  Highlight the severity of the deviations and potential impact on system performance or stability.
*   **solution:** Offer actionable steps to address the identified issues. Include suggestions for investigation, resource management, network optimization, monitoring improvements, and potentially rolling back recent changes if necessary.
