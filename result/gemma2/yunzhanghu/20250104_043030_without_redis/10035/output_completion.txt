	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(message) by (pod,namespace,node), AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,  getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeDeptObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from the normal range for several KPIs. Specifically, 'sum(message) by (pod,namespace,node)' indicates an increase in messages, potentially signaling communication issues or increased workload. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a decrease in performance, which could be due to database issues or authentication problems.  'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeDeptObjectIDs end' are also experiencing abnormal behavior, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval or processing.",
	"solution": "Investigate the increased message volume in 'sum(message) by (pod,namespace,node)' to identify the source of the issue.  Review logs and monitor system resources for bottlenecks or errors. Analyze the performance degradation in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the cause, such as database queries or authentication routines. Check the status of the databases and ensure proper indexing and query optimization. For 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeDeptObjectIDs end', review error logs and examine object retrieval processes for potential failures or resource constraints."
