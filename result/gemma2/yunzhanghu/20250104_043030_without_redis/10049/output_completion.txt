	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(getBackupEmp success)\nmessage\ndeploy-redis\nauthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:> \ngetBackupEmp success\nauthenticate",
	"reason": "There are significant fluctuations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'message', 'deploy-redis', 'authListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:> ', and 'authenticate' show abnormal increases or decreases, suggesting problems with data retrieval, authentication, or deployment processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the recent code modifications to identify potential bugs or configuration errors that might be causing these anomalies.\n2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze server and application logs for error messages or unusual activity around the time of the change.\n3. **Resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to see if any resources are being heavily consumed by affected processes.\n4. **Database performance:** Monitor database query performance and connections to rule out database-related issues.\n5. **Rollback changes (if possible):** If the issue is severe, consider reverting the recent changes to a stable state while further investigation is conducted."
