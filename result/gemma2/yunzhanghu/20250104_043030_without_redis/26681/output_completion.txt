	"reason": "Significant changes in CPU utilization, network traffic, and employee related KPIs indicate potential system instability.  Anomalous behavior in 'no employee' KPI suggests issues with data collection or processing related to employee information. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of increased CPU load and network traffic.** Examine resource consumption by individual processes and applications. 2. **Address anomalies in the 'no employee' KPI.** Review data pipelines and systems responsible for collecting and processing employee information. Look for errors, missing data, or inconsistent updates. 3. **Monitor system logs and error messages** to identify potential issues with specific components or services. 4. **Implement appropriate scaling strategies** if resource constraints are identified.  5. **Review security configurations and access controls** to rule out any malicious activities."
