	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant deviation from expected behavior in multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This suggests a potential system malfunction or configuration issue that requires immediate attention.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'container_memory_rss' KPI:** Analyze resource consumption patterns and identify potential memory leaks or inefficient application code.\n2. **Review the 'approve status error' KPI:** Examine the workflow processes associated with approvals to pinpoint bottlenecks or errors that are causing failures.\n3. **Analyze the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI:**  Investigate data structures or logic related to hierarchical relationships to identify missing or corrupted information.\n4. **Collect detailed logs and system metrics:** Gather comprehensive diagnostic information to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.\n5. **Test and implement corrective actions:** Based on the analysis, implement necessary code changes, configuration adjustments, or process improvements to restore normal system operation."
}
``` 


**Important Notes:**

*  The provided response assumes a "failure" classification based on the significant deviation in KPIs mentioned. 
*   To accurately identify the top 5 abnormal KPIs excluding 'build', you'll need to analyze the full dataset and prioritize those with the most substantial deviations from expected values.
