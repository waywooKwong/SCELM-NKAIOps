	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in the performance of several key KPIs after the change.  Notable increases in negative values and deviations from typical trends suggest potential issues. The 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI exhibits an alarming drop, potentially indicating authentication failures or user access problems. 'getBackupEmp success' also shows a concerning decrease, suggesting difficulties in performing backups.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI:** Analyze authentication logs for errors, examine configuration settings, and test user access permissions to identify and resolve any issues. 2. **Examine the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI:** Review backup logs, check system resources (disk space, CPU), and ensure that the backup process is configured correctly. Consider implementing monitoring for backups and alerts on potential failures."
