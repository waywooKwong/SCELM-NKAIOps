	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit significant deviations from normal behavior, indicating potential system instability. Notably, 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a downward trend after the change, suggesting database or network issues. 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' also indicate potential errors in data processing or application logic.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' KPI:** Analyze database logs and network performance metrics to identify any bottlenecks or errors occurring during this interval. 2. **Review the code related to 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error':** Look for potential logic errors, data validation issues, or external dependencies that may be causing these anomalies. 3. **Monitor system logs and error messages closely:** Identify any patterns or correlations between the observed KPI deviations and specific error messages. 4. **Roll back the recent changes if possible:** If the issue persists, reverting to a previous stable state can help isolate the source of the problem."

```


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the metrics clearly indicate issues after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** This section lists KPIs that show significant deviations. The specific order might need adjustment based on the severity and impact of each anomaly. I've included a placeholder for "irrelevantKPI1" which you should replace with an actual KPI from your output that seems unrelated to the major issues.
* **reason:** Provides a concise explanation of why the change is classified as a failure, linking the metric changes to potential system problems.
* **solution:** Suggests steps to investigate and address the identified issues.


**Remember:**

* Adapt the "Top 5 abnormal kpi" and "reason" sections based on your specific output and the context of the change.
* The solution suggestions are general guidelines; you'll need to tailor them to your specific environment and the nature of the problems detected.
