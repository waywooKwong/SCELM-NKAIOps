Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Can't find addEmp from updateEmp and empMapTo\npageResource all api not hava log\nscan: [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> \nsecuritySessionCheck GetSecuritySessionFromReq failed, err=securecookie: expired timestamp [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> \n[securitySessionCheck] GetSecuritySessionFromReq failed, err=securecookie: expired timestamp [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided metrics reveals a significant deviation from normal behavior. Multiple KPIs indicate performance degradation and potential errors within the system.  Specifically, numerous 'failed' or 'expired' logs suggest issues with session management and API calls. This points towards a potential configuration problem, server overload, or network connectivity issue.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Session Management**: Examine the 'securitySessionCheck' logs for patterns and root causes of expired timestamps. Review session timeout configurations and ensure they are appropriate.\n2. **Resource Monitoring**:  Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on affected servers to identify potential bottlenecks or overload. Consider scaling up resources if necessary.\n3. **Network Troubleshooting**: Verify network connectivity between components. Analyze network logs for errors or latency issues.\n4. **API Error Analysis**: Investigate the 'pageResource all api not hava log' error.  Check API endpoints, configuration, and request/response logs for clues about the issue.\n5. **Code Review**: Conduct a review of relevant code related to session management, API calls, and logging mechanisms. Look for potential bugs or inconsistencies."

**Important Notes:**

* **Specificity is Key**: The suggested solutions are general.  To effectively address the issues, you'll need to dig deeper into the specific logs, metrics, and system configurations mentioned in the output.
* **Context Matters**: This analysis assumes the provided data represents a snapshot of your system's health. Understanding the broader context (e.g., recent changes, user activity patterns) can provide valuable insights for diagnosis and resolution.
