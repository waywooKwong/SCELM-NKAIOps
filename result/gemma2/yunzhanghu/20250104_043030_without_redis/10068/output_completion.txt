{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loadRegoMySQLInterval success, parseDataReportFlag ok, superiorAndDeputy empty, approve status error,  GIN: request latency > 10ms ",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant performance degradation and potential system instability. Several KPIs related to data loading, processing, and system responsiveness show alarming increases in latency or errors. This suggests that the system is struggling to handle its workload effectively.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the increased latency in  'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'superiorAndDeputy empty', and 'approve status error'. 2. Analyze the resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) to identify bottlenecks. 3. Consider optimizing database queries and data processing pipelines. 4. Implement caching mechanisms to reduce redundant computations. 5. Monitor system logs for any error messages or warnings that may provide further insights into the problem."
