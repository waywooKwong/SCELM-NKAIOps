	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(rate(redis_cmd_duration_seconds_bucket[1m])) by (quantile)",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key metrics indicate potential system instability. KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show negative trends, suggesting performance issues or errors.  The high sum of redis_cmd_duration_seconds_bucket indicates a slow response time for Redis operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' by analyzing logs, tracing requests, and monitoring resource utilization.** 2. **Optimize Redis configurations to improve response times and reduce latency. Consider techniques like caching, query optimization, and adjusting connection parameters.** 3. **Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for critical KPIs to proactively identify and address performance issues before they impact users.**"
