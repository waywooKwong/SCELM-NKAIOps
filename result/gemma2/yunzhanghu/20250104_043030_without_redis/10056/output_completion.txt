	"solution": "Investigate the specific cause of the anomalies in each KPI.\n* **AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>**: Review authentication logs and configurations for any errors or unexpected behavior.\n* **getBackupEmp success**: Analyze backup processes and verify successful data retrieval.\n* **sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total...))**: Examine network traffic patterns and troubleshoot potential bottlenecks or resource constraints.\n* **message**: Investigate message queues and communication channels for delays or errors. \nConsider monitoring system resources and logs for further insights into the root cause of these anomalies."
