	"reason": "The provided metrics show a significant shift in several key performance indicators after the change. This suggests that the implemented changes have negatively impacted system stability and functionality.  For example, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit reversed trends, indicating potential issues with authentication and data retrieval processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced and analyze their impact on the affected systems. Focus on debugging areas related to authentication, data access, and communication pathways. Retest functionalities and monitor key metrics closely after implementing any corrective measures."
