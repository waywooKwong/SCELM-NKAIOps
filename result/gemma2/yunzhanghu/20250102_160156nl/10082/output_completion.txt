	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes", 
	"reason": "The change introduced anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm,  indicating a deviation from expected behavior patterns. The specific anomaly 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' strongly suggests a failure in the change implementation.",
	"solution": "1. **Review and debug the software changes**: Carefully examine the code changes introduced to identify the root cause of the wrong IP address configuration. \n2. **Validate configurations**: Double-check all network configurations, including firewall rules and routing tables, to ensure they are aligned with the intended setup.\n3. **Rollback or revert the change**: If the issue persists, consider reverting the recent changes to restore the previous stable state while further investigation is conducted.  \n4. **Implement thorough testing**: Before deploying any future changes, enforce rigorous testing procedures to identify potential issues early on."
