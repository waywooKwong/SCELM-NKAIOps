	"reason": "The identified anomalies, including 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes', indicate a significant deviation from expected behavior. The presence of new log patterns and exceeding threshold values suggest the implemented changes have introduced issues.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediately investigate the code changes:** Focus on reviewing the sections related to IP addresses, configuration settings, and software components identified as defective. 2. **Review logs for detailed error messages:** Analyze the newly generated log patterns to pinpoint the exact nature of the errors and their timestamps. 3. **Roll back the changes if possible:** Consider reverting the recent changes to restore the system to a stable state while investigations are ongoing. 4. **Engage relevant teams:** Collaborate with developers, system administrators, and QA engineers to thoroughly diagnose and resolve the identified issues."
