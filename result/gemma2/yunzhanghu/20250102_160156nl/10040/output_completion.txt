	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes", 
	"reason": "The provided anomaly metric cluster directly indicates 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes'. This strongly suggests a failure as injected data from a virtual platform is not expected to produce such errors. Furthermore, the detection of new log patterns points towards unexpected behavior stemming from the change.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback:** Immediately revert the recent changes to restore the system to its previous state. 2. **Thorough Code Review:** Carefully examine the code modifications introduced by the change to identify the root cause of the IP address and configuration errors. 3. **Configuration Validation:** Double-check all system configurations, particularly those related to network settings and software installations, to ensure they are accurate and consistent. 4. **Logging Analysis:** Analyze the newly generated log patterns to gain a deeper understanding of the error behavior and identify specific points of failure."
