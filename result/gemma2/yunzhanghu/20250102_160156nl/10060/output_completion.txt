	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes", 
	"reason": "The change resulted in 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes', indicating a failure. The 'Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies' are exceeding thresholds, suggesting system instability. Additionally, the presence of a new log structure pattern points towards unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediate Rollback:**  Temporarily revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact. 2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the code and configuration changes to pinpoint the exact source of the IP address errors and software defects. 3. **Configuration Review:** Scrutinize network configurations, firewalls, and routing tables for any misconfigurations that might be causing the IP address issues. 4. **Software Defect Remediation:** Address the identified software defects through bug fixes or patches.  5. **Logging Enhancement:** Improve logging mechanisms to capture more detailed information about system events and potential errors."
