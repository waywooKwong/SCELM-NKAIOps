Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "NA", 
	"reason": "The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies at specific timestamps (2023-11-10 12:44:25 and 2023-11-10 14:04:25). However,  all indicator data does not exceed the threshold. This suggests that while there might be minor fluctuations or transient events detected, they are within acceptable limits and do not indicate a significant performance degradation.",
	"solution": "NA"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided information indicates:

* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies.
* **Threshold Exceeding:**  Despite the anomalies, all indicator data is within the threshold. This means the system's performance metrics are functioning within acceptable ranges.

Based on these points, the change can be classified as "normal".
