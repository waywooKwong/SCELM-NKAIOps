	"reason": "The provided data clearly indicates a failure due to the presence of 'Wrong IP Address', 'Configuration Errors', and 'Defective Software Changes'. These are serious issues that directly point towards problems with the implemented changes.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediately investigate the root cause of these errors:**  This requires reviewing recent code changes, system logs, and configuration files to pinpoint the exact source of the problems.\n2. **Rollback the problematic changes:** If possible, revert to the previous stable state to restore normal system operation while investigating further.\n3. **Thoroughly test any fixes:** Before re-implementing changes, conduct rigorous testing to ensure they resolve the issues and do not introduce new problems.\n4. **Implement stricter change management procedures:**  Enforce a more robust review process for future changes, including code reviews, thorough testing, and documentation of all modifications."
