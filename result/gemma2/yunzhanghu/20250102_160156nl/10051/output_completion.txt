	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant number of anomalies (730 total) and 32 anomalous KPIs. The specific mention of 'Wrong IP Address,' 'Configuration Errors,' and 'Defective Software Changes' points towards systemic issues introduced by the recent change. This is further supported by the detection of a newly generated log pattern, suggesting unexpected behavior within the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediately rollback the recent change:**  This will help mitigate the ongoing issues while investigations continue.\n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Identify the specific modifications that might have caused the IP address, configuration, or software defects.\n3. **Analyze the newly generated logs:** Examine the log entries for clues about the nature of the errors and their frequency.\n4. **Implement rigorous testing procedures:** Ensure that future changes undergo comprehensive testing to prevent similar issues from occurring again."
