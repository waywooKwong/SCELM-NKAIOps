	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies, including 'Wrong IP Address', 'Configuration Errors', and 'Defective Software Changes'.  These issues indicate a failure to adhere to standard processes and lead to potential service disruptions.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediately Rollback the Change:** To mitigate immediate impact, revert the recent changes affecting the system configuration. 2. **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a comprehensive investigation into the root cause of these anomalies. This includes examining code changes, configuration files, and logs to pinpoint the exact source of the problems. 3. **Remediation:** Once the root cause is identified, implement corrective actions to address the issues.  This may involve fixing faulty code, adjusting configurations, or implementing additional safeguards to prevent similar errors in the future. 4. **Testing & Validation:** After remediation, rigorously test the system to ensure the anomalies are resolved and that service stability is restored. Implement comprehensive testing procedures to prevent similar failures in the future."
