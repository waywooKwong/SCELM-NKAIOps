	"reason": "The provided anomaly metrics directly indicate a failure.  Specifically, 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' suggest a critical issue with the deployed software.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediate Rollback:** Initiate a rollback of the recent change to restore the system to its previous stable state.\n2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the exact cause of the configuration errors and defective software changes. This may involve reviewing code, deployment logs, and system configurations.\n3. **Bug Fixing and Retesting:** Once the root cause is identified, fix the bugs and implement necessary changes. Rigorously test the corrected code in a controlled environment before redeploying it to production.\n4. **Enhanced Change Management:** Review and strengthen change management processes to prevent similar issues in the future. This may include more rigorous code reviews, automated testing, and stricter deployment controls."
