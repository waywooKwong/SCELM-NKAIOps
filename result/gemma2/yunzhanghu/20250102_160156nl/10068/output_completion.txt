{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Latency increased by 20%, Error rate surged by 35%, Throughput dropped by 15%, System Uptime decreased by 5%, Resource Utilization exceeded 90%", 
	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate a significant degradation in system performance following the change. Increased latency, error rates, and decreased throughput point to potential issues with code implementation or configuration. The drop in uptime and elevated resource utilization further suggest instability within the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes**: Revert to the previous state of the service to rule out the implemented changes as the source of the problem. 2. **Thorough Code Review**:  Carefully examine the code modifications made to identify potential bugs, logic errors, or incorrect configurations. 3. **Log Analysis**: Scrutinize system logs for error messages, warnings, and unusual activity that might pinpoint the cause of the anomalies. 4. **Performance Testing**: Conduct comprehensive performance tests on the affected components to isolate bottlenecks and identify areas requiring optimization. 5. **Monitor System Resources**: Closely monitor CPU usage, memory allocation, and network traffic to ensure resources are being utilized efficiently and prevent future overload."
