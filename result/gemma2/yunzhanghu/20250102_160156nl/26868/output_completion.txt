Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "NA",
	"reason": "The data provided indicates that all indicator data is within the expected thresholds. There are no significant deviations in KPIs, and no new log patterns indicative of failure were detected.",
	"solution": "NA"
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

Based on the information given, the change appears to be **normal**.  Here's why:

* **No KPI Deviations:** The text explicitly states that all indicator data is within expected thresholds. This means there are no significant performance drops or errors related to the change.
* **No New Log Patterns:** While new log patterns can sometimes signal issues, the text doesn't mention any concerning patterns emerging from this change. 

* **SCWARN Anomaly Identification:** Although the SCWARN algorithm flagged some anomalies, it's important to understand the context of these alerts. Without further information on what triggered these flags and their severity, we cannot definitively say they are related to a failed change.




Let me know if you have more details about the SCWARN alerts or any other metrics that could provide a clearer picture of the situation!
