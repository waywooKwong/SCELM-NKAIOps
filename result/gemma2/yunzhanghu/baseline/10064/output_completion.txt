{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getPermTagsAndValues,  container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, loadRegoMySQLInterval success,  superiorAndDeputy empty,  approve status error",
	"reason": "The data ranges of multiple KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'getPermTagsAndValues', 'container_cpu_usage_seconds_total', and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' show wider ranges and shifted means, suggesting performance degradation or resource contention. 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' also exhibit unusual changes, hinting at potential logic errors or data inconsistencies.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the specific modifications affecting these KPIs. 2. Analyze the logs and system metrics for further insights into the performance bottlenecks or errors. 3. Consider reverting the changes if they demonstrably worsen the system's behavior. 4. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect and address similar issues in the future."
