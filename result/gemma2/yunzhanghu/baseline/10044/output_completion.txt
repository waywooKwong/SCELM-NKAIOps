	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their data ranges and trends after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  has a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  also exhibit shifts in their ranges and trends, suggesting potential disruptions in their respective functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and address any issues with policy loading. Further analysis is required to understand the impact of the changes on 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and implement appropriate solutions."
