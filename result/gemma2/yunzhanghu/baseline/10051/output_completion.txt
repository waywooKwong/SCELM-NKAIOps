	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' show a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. Similarly, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit changes in their mean and range, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval and authorization processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to policy loading, object retrieval, and authorization. Analyze logs and error messages to pinpoint the source of the issues. Consider reverting the changes or implementing fixes to restore the KPIs to their normal ranges."
