	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have drastically changed after the modification, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' show a significant decrease in range, suggesting a possible policy loading problem. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit increased ranges, indicating potential issues with object identification and department management. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a negative shift in the mean, suggesting problems with MySQL interval loading. 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{...}))' also shows a change in range, indicating network traffic fluctuations. These combined anomalies suggest a broader system-level issue.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to policy loading, object identification, department management, MySQL interval loading, and network traffic. Analyze logs and system metrics for further insights into the root cause of these anomalies. Consider reverting the changes if they are identified as the primary cause of the issues. Implement appropriate fixes and thoroughly test the system after resolving the problems."
