	"reason": "The data ranges for many KPIs have significantly changed after the update, indicating potential issues.  Several KPIs show a downward trend, suggesting decreased performance or errors.  Specifically, KPIs related to 'std_requests_total', 'list modules', 'callback status', 'getBackupEm', and 'get metadata from header' exhibit notable changes. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications made during the update to pinpoint the source of the issues. 2. **Monitor affected services:** Closely monitor the performance and logs of the services impacted by these KPIs. 3. **Roll back changes:** If the issues are severe, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous stable state. 4. **Test thoroughly:** After addressing the issues, conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system functions correctly and performance is restored."
