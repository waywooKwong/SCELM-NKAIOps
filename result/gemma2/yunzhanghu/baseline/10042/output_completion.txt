	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shifted significantly after the change. This indicates potential issues with the implemented changes.  For example, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  shows a drastic decrease in minimum and maximum values, suggesting a problem with policy loading. Similarly, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit expanded ranges, implying unexpected behavior in these processes. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show notable changes in their ranges.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies.  Review logs and monitor system resource utilization during the affected period. Consider reverting the changes or implementing targeted fixes to restore the KPIs to their expected ranges."
