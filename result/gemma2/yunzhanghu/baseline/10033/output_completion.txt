	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic decrease in maximum and mean values, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show increased variance, indicating instability. 'getBackupEmp success' also exhibits a reduced range, potentially affecting backup operations. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a narrowed range, which might imply issues with authorization processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to policy loading, department member operations, backup processes, and authorization mechanisms. Analyze logs and error messages for further insights into the root cause of these anomalies. Consider reverting the changes or implementing fixes to restore the KPIs to their expected ranges."
