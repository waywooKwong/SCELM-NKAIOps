	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a downward trend in mean and a decrease in range, suggesting a potential decrease in request rate or module performance. 'callback status error', 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' and 'get metadata from header' also exhibit changes in range, indicating potential errors or instability in these functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to the affected KPIs. Analyze the logs and monitoring data for any error messages or performance bottlenecks. Identify the root cause of the changes and implement necessary fixes to restore the KPIs to their normal ranges."
