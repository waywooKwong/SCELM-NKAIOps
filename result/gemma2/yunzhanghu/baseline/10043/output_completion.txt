	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show changes in both minimum and maximum values, suggesting potential problems with object ID retrieval and authentication processes. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI to determine why the range has shrunk. Review the logs and configuration related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify the root cause of the data range shifts. Consider rolling back the recent changes if the issue persists."
