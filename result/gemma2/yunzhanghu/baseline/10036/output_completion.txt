	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly shifted after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a dramatic decrease in minimum values and an increase in maximum values, indicating potential issues with policy loading and object retrieval. Similarly, 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit altered trends and ranges, suggesting problems with department management, backup operations, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes implemented to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Review logs and system events related to policy loading, object retrieval, department management, backup operations, and authentication. Consider reverting the recent changes or implementing targeted fixes to restore normal KPI behavior."
