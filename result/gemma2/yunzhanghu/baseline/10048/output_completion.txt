	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in performance after the change. Several KPIs, particularly 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' which dropped to zero, and KPIs related to department operations and authentication ('Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>') show unusual changes in their ranges and trends. This suggests potential issues with policy loading, department functionality, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' anomaly first, as it indicates a complete halt in policy loading. Check for errors in policy deployment or configuration. Simultaneously, review logs and system events related to the affected department operations and authentication processes to pinpoint the root cause of the changes in those KPIs. Consider rolling back the recent change if it appears to be the primary cause of these issues."
}

**Explanation of the Response:**

* **change_type:** Classified as "failure" because the data clearly shows negative changes in multiple KPIs after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Selected KPIs that demonstrate the most significant and concerning deviations from their previous behavior.  The exclusion of "build" KPIs is based on the specific instruction.
* **reason:** Provides a concise explanation of the observed issues, highlighting the key affected areas (policy loading, department operations, authentication).
* **solution:** Offers a structured approach to resolving the issues:
    * Prioritize investigating the 'loaded policy count' anomaly.
    * Examine logs and system events related to the affected department operations and authentication.
    * Consider a rollback if the recent change is the primary culprit.
