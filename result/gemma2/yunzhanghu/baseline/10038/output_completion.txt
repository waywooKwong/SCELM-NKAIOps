{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic decrease in minimum and maximum values, suggesting problems with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit changes in both minimum and maximum values, hinting at potential errors in data retrieval or processing. 'message' shows a shift in trend from up to down, indicating a change in message patterns that requires investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:** Analyze the reasons behind the policy loading problems and implement solutions to ensure proper policy loading. 2. **Review the data retrieval and processing logic for 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success':** Identify potential bugs or inconsistencies that might be causing the data range shifts. 3. **Monitor the 'message' KPI closely:** Analyze the changed message patterns to understand the underlying cause and take appropriate actions to address them."
