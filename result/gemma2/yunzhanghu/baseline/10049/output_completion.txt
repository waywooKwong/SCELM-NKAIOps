	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to zero, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show increased negative values, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval or department management. 'getBackupEmp success' also shows a decrease in success rate, hinting at backup issues. 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{...}))' indicates a decline in network traffic, which could be a symptom of service disruption.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate policy loading issues:** Analyze logs and system configurations related to policy loading to identify the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drop. 2. **Review object retrieval and department management:** Examine the code and configurations related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to pinpoint the source of negative value increases. 3. **Troubleshoot backup failures:** Analyze backup logs and system settings to diagnose the 'getBackupEmp success' decrease and implement corrective actions. 4. **Monitor network traffic:** Continuously monitor network traffic patterns and investigate any significant drops or anomalies. Analyze application logs and system metrics for potential bottlenecks or resource constraints."
