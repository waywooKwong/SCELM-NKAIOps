	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Depts only have yunzhanghu, getPermTagsAndValues, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues', 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' show a notable change in trend and range, suggesting potential issues with data processing, system performance, or user behavior. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes made**: Review the code and configuration changes implemented to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. 2. **Monitor affected systems**: Closely monitor the systems and services impacted by the change to identify any performance bottlenecks or errors. 3. **Analyze user behavior**: Examine user logs and activity to understand if any changes in user interactions contribute to the observed KPI deviations. 4. **Rollback or revert the change**: If the anomalies are severe and cannot be immediately addressed, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous state. 5. **Implement mitigation strategies**: Based on the identified root cause, implement appropriate solutions to address the performance issues and stabilize the KPIs."
