	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs show significant shifts in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to a constant 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' all show increased minimum values and decreased maximum values, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or errors in these operations.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue. Analyze logs and system resources for the affected KPIs to identify bottlenecks or errors. Consider rolling back the change or implementing mitigations to address the observed performance degradation."
