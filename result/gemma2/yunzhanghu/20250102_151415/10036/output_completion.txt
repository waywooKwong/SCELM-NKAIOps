{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "computedOwnObjectIDs end,getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,message,sum(requests)",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'computedOwnObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', and 'sum(requests)' exhibit substantial increases or decreases, indicating potential issues with resource utilization, request handling, or authentication mechanisms.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'computedOwnObjectIDs end' KPI:** Analyze the code responsible for this operation to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms. Consider optimizing database queries or utilizing caching mechanisms. 2. **Review 'getBackupEmp success' data:**  Examine log files and error reports related to backup operations. Identify any frequent failures or timeouts that might be impacting the KPI. Ensure proper resource allocation for backup processes. 3. **Analyze 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' performance:** Look into authentication procedures and ensure they are performing efficiently. Investigate potential issues with user account management or authorization rules. 4. **Monitor 'message' trends:**  Identify the source of messages impacting this KPI. Investigate any spikes in error messages or exceptions that might indicate underlying system problems. 5. **Optimize 'sum(requests)' handling:** Analyze request patterns and implement load balancing techniques to distribute incoming requests effectively. Consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce server load."
