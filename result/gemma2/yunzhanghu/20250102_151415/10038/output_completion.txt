	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "1.getBackupEmp success \n2. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n3. computeOwnObjectIDs end \n4. message\n5.  sum(requests) ",
	"reason": "The analysis of the metrics reveals several key issues:\n*   Significant fluctuations in 'getBackupEmp success', indicating potential problems with backup operations.\n*   'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a shift in its distribution, suggesting authentication processes may be affected.\n*   'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibits anomalous behavior, possibly pointing to issues with object identification routines.\n*   'message' experiences unexpected changes, hinting at communication problems within the system.\n*  sum(requests) increase significantly. ",
	"solution": "1. Investigate and resolve the root cause of the backup failures reported by 'getBackupEmp success'.\n2. Thoroughly examine the authentication mechanisms related to 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify and rectify any inconsistencies.\n3. Debug the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' process to pinpoint the source of the anomalies and implement corrective measures.\n4. Analyze the patterns in 'message' to understand the communication issues and implement appropriate solutions.\n5. Monitor and analyze the 'sum(requests)' trends, identifying potential bottlenecks or resource constraints and taking steps to optimize system performance."
