	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals several KPIs exhibiting significant deviations from their expected patterns. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success' shows a positive trend shift after the change, suggesting potential improvements in backup retrieval processes. However, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' display downward trends with considerable fluctuations, indicating possible issues related to authentication or communication within the system.  The anomalies observed in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' could point towards problems with object identification or management.",
	"solution": "Investigate the reasons behind the positive trend shift in 'getBackupEmp success' and leverage those insights for further optimization. Conduct a thorough review of the authentication mechanisms used by 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' to identify and rectify any vulnerabilities or inconsistencies. Analyze the anomalies in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to pinpoint the root cause and implement corrective measures to ensure proper object identification and management."
