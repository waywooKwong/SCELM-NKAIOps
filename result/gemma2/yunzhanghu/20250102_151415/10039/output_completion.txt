{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "computeOwnObjectIDs end, getBackupEmp success, message, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, sum(requests) by (method)",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals several KPIs exhibit anomalous trends after the change.  KPIs like 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' show significant deviations from their expected patterns, indicating potential performance issues or unexpected behavior. Additionally, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'sum(requests) by (method)' demonstrate unusual fluctuations that warrant further investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the recent code modifications to pinpoint the specific alterations that might be impacting these KPIs. 2. **Monitor resource utilization:** Track CPU, memory, and network usage during periods when anomalies occur to identify potential bottlenecks or resource constraints. 3. **Analyze logs and error messages:** Scrutinize logs for any relevant errors or warnings that might shed light on the root cause of the issues. 4. **Conduct load testing:** Perform comprehensive load tests to assess the system's resilience under various stress scenarios and identify areas requiring improvement. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect anomalies and trigger timely notifications."
