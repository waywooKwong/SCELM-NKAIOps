{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(requests)",
	"reason": "The system is experiencing performance degradation as evidenced by several KPIs exceeding their thresholds or showing significant deviations. Specifically, metrics like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' indicate slow response times or increased latency. Additionally, 'message'  shows a potential bottleneck in request processing. This suggests underlying resource constraints, network issues, or faulty code execution.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of performance degradation by analyzing system logs, monitoring resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk), and network traffic. \n2. Optimize database queries and application code to reduce latency. \n3. Consider scaling up resources if necessary (e.g., adding more servers or increasing memory allocation). \n4. Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on frequently accessed data. \n5. If network issues are identified, explore solutions like optimizing bandwidth usage or upgrading network infrastructure."

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type**: Set to "failure" because the provided metrics indicate performance problems exceeding normal thresholds.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  Selected KPIs based on their significant deviations and potential impact on system functionality. The list excludes "build" named KPIs as instructed.  
* **reason**: Provides a general explanation for the failure based on the given metrics, highlighting potential causes like resource constraints, network issues, or inefficient code. 
* **solution**: Offers actionable steps to address the identified problems, focusing on root cause analysis, performance optimization, resource scaling, caching strategies, and network troubleshooting.
