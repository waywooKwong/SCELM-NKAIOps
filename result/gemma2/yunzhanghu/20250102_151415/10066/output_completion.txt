	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  This includes notable drops in 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and increases in 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error'. These anomalies suggest potential issues with data processing, system resource utilization, or workflow execution.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'parseDataReportFlag ok' KPI:** Analyze the logs and data flow to identify why this flag is no longer being set correctly. Check for data integrity issues or configuration changes that might be causing this.\n2. **Examine 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success':**  The sudden drop to zero suggests a complete failure in loading Rego MySQL intervals.  Review error logs, database connections, and system resource availability.\n3. **Address the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI:** Determine why this field is becoming more frequently empty. This could indicate problems with data retrieval or population logic. Review relevant code and configurations.\n4. **Investigate 'approve status error':** Analyze error logs and workflow executions to pinpoint the causes of these errors. Potential issues might lie in approval processes, permissions, or data synchronization.\n5. **Review build <:*:> [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ]:** Analyze traces for potential bottlenecks or errors that could be impacting performance and contributing to the overall anomalies."
