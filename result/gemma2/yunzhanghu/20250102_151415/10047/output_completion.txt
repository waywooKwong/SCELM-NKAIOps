	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant increase in errors and latency across various system components. This suggests potential performance issues or resource contention.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the top 5 abnormal KPIs further to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. \n2. Analyze system logs and error messages for clues about the nature of the problems. \n3. Consider increasing resource allocation (CPU, memory) if resource contention is suspected. \n4. Optimize database queries or application code to improve performance. \n5. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and address potential issues in the future."
