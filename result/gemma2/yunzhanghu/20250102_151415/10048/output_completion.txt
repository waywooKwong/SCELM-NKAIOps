{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(request)",
	"reason": "The data analysis shows several KPIs have significant deviations from their normal ranges after the change. This indicates potential issues with system performance, resource utilization, or data integrity.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in the top 5 abnormal kpis.\n2. Review recent changes to the system configuration or codebase that may have contributed to these deviations.\n3. Monitor key metrics closely and implement appropriate logging and alerting mechanisms to detect future anomalies.\n4. Consider rolling back the recent changes if they are identified as the primary cause of the issue."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type**: "failure" because the data shows deviations from normal ranges, indicating potential issues.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: These KPIs show significant changes post-update. The list excludes "build" KPIs as requested.
* **reason**:  The analysis highlights performance and data integrity concerns due to the observed KPI anomalies.
* **solution**: A structured approach is suggested, involving root cause analysis, change review, enhanced monitoring, and potential rollback if necessary.
