	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,  sum(value) by (job), message, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals several KPIs with significant deviations from their expected patterns. Specifically, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibits a downward trend in performance after the change, indicating potential issues with user authentication or authorization.  'getBackupEmp success' also shows a similar pattern of decline. Additionally, 'sum(value) by (job)' indicates unusual job execution behavior, suggesting underlying system instability. The increased variability in 'message' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' further reinforces the presence of anomalies.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' by examining authentication logs and user access patterns. Analyze the impact of the change on the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI and identify potential bottlenecks or errors in the backup process.  Monitor 'sum(value) by (job)' closely to detect recurring issues and proactively address them. Review system logs and resource utilization metrics for 'message' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to pinpoint any performance bottlenecks or configuration problems."
