	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success,message,computeOwnObjectIDs end,  sum(requests) by (method)",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges, indicating potential issues. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows an increase in maximum value and decrease in mean, suggesting a possible surge in requests or changes in user behavior. 'getBackupEmp success' exhibits a similar pattern, hinting at potential problems with backup processes.  'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'sum(requests) by (method)' also show abnormal behavior, indicating potential errors or bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Analyze logs, monitor system resource usage, and review recent code changes to identify contributing factors. Implement monitoring alerts for these KPIs to proactively detect future issues."
