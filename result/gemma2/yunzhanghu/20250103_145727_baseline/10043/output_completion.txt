	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loadedData success , getBackupEmp success , AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> , message, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal patterns.  Several KPIs related to data loading, authentication, and system operations show anomalies, suggesting potential issues with data processing, user access, or underlying infrastructure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loadedData success' KPI:** Analyze logs and system resources to identify bottlenecks or errors during data loading processes. 2. **Review the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI:** Examine backup procedures and ensure successful execution. Check for file integrity and any potential corruption. 3. **Analyze the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI:**  Scrutinize authentication logs for suspicious activity or access attempts. Verify user permissions and system configurations. 4. **Monitor the 'message' KPI closely:** Investigate the nature of the messages (errors, warnings) and their frequency. Identify potential sources and address them accordingly. 5. **Examine the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPI:** Analyze the object ID processing and ensure efficient resource utilization. Look for performance bottlenecks or memory leaks."
