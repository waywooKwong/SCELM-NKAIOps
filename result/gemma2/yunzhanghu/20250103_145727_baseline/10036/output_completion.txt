	"reason": "The metrics show several KPIs have significantly deviated from their usual ranges. This suggests a potential issue with resource utilization, performance bottlenecks, or unexpected behavior within the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the top 5 abnormal KPIs:**  Analyze logs and system events related to these KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the deviations. \n2. **Monitor resource usage:** Keep a close eye on CPU, memory, and network utilization to identify potential bottlenecks. \n3. **Review recent changes:** Check for any recent code deployments or configuration updates that might have contributed to the anomalies. \n4. **Scale resources:** If necessary, consider scaling up resources (CPU, memory) to accommodate increased load or demands.\n5. **Optimize performance:** Identify and address any performance bottlenecks in the application code or infrastructure."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**:  The data clearly indicates abnormal behavior across multiple KPIs, pointing to a potential failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We've selected the KPIs that exhibit the most significant deviations from their normal ranges, excluding those named "build". This helps focus the investigation on key areas of concern. 
* **reason**: The deviation in KPIs suggests underlying problems like resource contention, performance issues, or unexpected system behavior.
* **solution**: A multi-pronged approach is recommended: investigate the root cause through logs and monitoring, optimize resource utilization, review recent changes, and consider scaling resources if needed.
