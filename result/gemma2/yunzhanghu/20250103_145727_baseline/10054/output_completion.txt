	"reason": "The data analysis shows that several KPIs, including 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and  'computeOwnObjectIDs end', have experienced significant deviations from their normal ranges. This indicates potential issues within the system.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This could involve examining logs, monitoring system resources, and analyzing the code related to the affected KPIs. Potential solutions might include: \n\n* Reviewing the configuration of the 'getBackupEmp' process.\n* Investigating potential conflicts or issues within the 'AuthListByName' function.\n* Analyzing the message logs for errors or unusual patterns.\n* Debugging the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' logic to identify any performance bottlenecks or logic flaws."
