	"reason": "The system is experiencing performance issues and anomalies in several key metrics. This suggests a potential problem with resource utilization, code execution efficiency, or data processing bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource usage:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network consumption of affected services to identify potential resource contention. 2. **Profile code performance:** Analyze the performance of critical code paths within the system to pinpoint inefficient logic or hotspots. 3. **Optimize data processing:** Review data pipelines and storage mechanisms for bottlenecks and implement optimizations. 4. **Implement logging and monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to track system behavior and identify recurring issues."
