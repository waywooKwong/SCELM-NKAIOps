	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal behavior. Several KPIs related to memory usage, network traffic, and business logic show anomalies, suggesting potential resource constraints or application errors.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following steps:\n1. Analyze the `container_memory_rss` KPI for excessive memory consumption. Identify resource-intensive processes and optimize code or configurations.\n2. Examine the `superiorAndDeputy` KPI for unexpected values. This might indicate issues with data synchronization or business logic.\n3. Review logs and error messages associated with the `approve status error` KPI to pinpoint the cause of failures.\n4. Monitor network traffic using `container_network_receive` and `container_network_transmit` KPIs. Address any bottlenecks or spikes in network usage.\n5. Consider scaling resources if necessary based on the observed performance metrics."
