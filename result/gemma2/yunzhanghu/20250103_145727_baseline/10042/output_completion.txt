	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The provided KPI data indicates several instances of significant deviation from expected behavior. KPIs such as 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and others show unusual fluctuations in their minimum and maximum values, suggesting potential issues within the systems they represent.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root causes of these anomalies. This could involve examining system logs, monitoring resource utilization, and reviewing recent code changes.  Addressing potential bottlenecks, optimizing resource allocation, and implementing robust error handling mechanisms may be necessary to mitigate these issues."
