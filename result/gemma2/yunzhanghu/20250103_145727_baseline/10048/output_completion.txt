	"reason": "The provided metrics show several KPIs with significant deviations from their expected ranges after the change. This indicates potential performance issues or data corruption.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the impacted KPIs:**  Analyze the logs and system behavior surrounding 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', and 'sum(requests)' to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.\n2. **Review recent code changes:** Compare the codebase before and after the change to identify any potential bugs or unintended consequences that might be affecting these KPIs.\n3. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O to ensure sufficient resources are available for the affected processes.\n4. **Rollback the recent changes:** If possible, revert the changes to a previous stable state to isolate the issue and gather further insights.\n5. **Test thoroughly:** After addressing the identified issues, conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system functions correctly and the anomalies are resolved."
