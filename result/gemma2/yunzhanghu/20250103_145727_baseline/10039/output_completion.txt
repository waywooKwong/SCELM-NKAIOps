	"reason": "The data for several KPIs, including 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'summary', 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeDeptObjectIDs end', shows significant deviations from the expected range. This suggests potential issues with data collection, processing, or underlying system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the affected KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.  Review logs, monitor system resources, and check for any recent changes that might have contributed to the issue. Based on the findings, implement appropriate solutions such as code fixes, configuration adjustments, or hardware upgrades."
