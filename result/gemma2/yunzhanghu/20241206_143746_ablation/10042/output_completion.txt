	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show drastically reduced ranges, suggesting potential issues with data loading or processing. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit changes in their distribution, pointing to possible problems with department management, backup operations, or authentication processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI:** Analyze the reasons behind the reduced range. Check for errors in data loading, policy retrieval, or database queries. \n2. **Review 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and related processes:** Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in object ID management. Optimize database queries or consider alternative storage solutions.\n3. **Examine 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' for anomalies:**  Scrutinize the changes in their distributions. Look for inconsistencies, errors, or unexpected patterns in department management, backup operations, or authentication logs. \n4. **Monitor system logs and error messages:** Identify any specific errors or warnings that correlate with the observed KPI changes. \n5. **Roll back the recent changes if possible:** If the issue is recent, consider reverting the changes to assess their impact.
