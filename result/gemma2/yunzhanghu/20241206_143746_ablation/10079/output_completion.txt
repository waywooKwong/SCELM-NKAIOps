	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "42.kpi name: sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~"4..",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m])), 43.kpi name: <:list modules:>, 45.kpi name: getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>, 50.kpi name: ClientEnvHandler is <:*:>,  ",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in data ranges and trends after the change. Several KPIs, such as 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~"4..",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))', '<:list modules:>' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' show a drastic reduction in their maximum values and a change in trend from up to down. This suggests a potential issue with the change affecting the performance or functionality of these components.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code changes introduced to identify any potential issues affecting the mentioned KPIs. 2. **Monitor logs and system metrics:** Analyze logs and system metrics for any errors or anomalies related to the affected components. 3. **Rollback the changes:** If possible, rollback the changes and test the system again to isolate the issue. 4. **Test and debug:** Conduct thorough testing and debugging to identify the root cause of the problem and implement a solution."
