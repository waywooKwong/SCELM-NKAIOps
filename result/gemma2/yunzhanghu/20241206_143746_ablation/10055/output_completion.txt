	"reason": "The system experienced a significant shift in performance metrics after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' which dropped to 0, and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8', which showed an unexpected upward trend, indicate potential issues. Other KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' also exhibit changes in their ranges, suggesting broader system instability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI drop:** Determine the root cause of the policy count reaching 0. This could be due to a configuration issue, data loss, or a problem with the policy loading mechanism. 2. **Analyze the 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' trend:**  Identify the specific pods, namespaces, or nodes contributing to this increase. Analyze network traffic patterns and resource utilization to pinpoint the cause. 3. **Review the changes made:** Carefully examine the code and configuration changes introduced. Look for potential bugs, unintended consequences, or conflicts that could be affecting the KPIs. 4. **Monitor system logs and metrics:** Closely monitor system logs, application logs, and relevant KPIs for any further anomalies or errors. 5. **Rollback if necessary:** If the issue persists, consider rolling back the recent changes to a stable state and then gradually reintroduce changes to isolate the root cause."
