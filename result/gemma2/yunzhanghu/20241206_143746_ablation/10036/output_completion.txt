	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly shifted after the change.  Specifically, KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a dramatic decrease in minimum values and an increase in maximum values, indicating potential performance degradation.  Similarly, KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit unusual changes in their distribution. These anomalies suggest that the change may have introduced unexpected side effects or bugs.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced with the change to identify potential issues causing the KPI deviations. 2. **Monitor affected systems:** Closely monitor the systems and components impacted by the change, paying attention to resource utilization, error logs, and performance metrics. 3. **Rollback the change:** If the anomalies are severe and negatively impacting system performance, consider rolling back the change to the previous stable state. 4. **Test and debug:** Implement rigorous testing procedures to identify and fix the root causes of the anomalies before deploying any further changes."
