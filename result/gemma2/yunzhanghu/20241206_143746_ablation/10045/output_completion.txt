	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shifted significantly after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has drastically reduced its range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show changes in their mean and range, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or errors in these functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following areas:\n* **'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'**: Analyze why policy loading has decreased. Check for potential issues with policy retrieval, deployment, or configuration.\n* **'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**:  Profile these functions to identify performance bottlenecks. Examine code for potential inefficiencies or errors. Review logs for any relevant error messages. Consider optimizing database queries or caching strategies."

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the data indicates negative changes in several KPIs.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Selected based on the magnitude of change and potential impact on system functionality.
* **reason:**  Provides a concise explanation of the observed changes and their potential causes.
* **solution:** Offers actionable steps to investigate and address the identified issues.
