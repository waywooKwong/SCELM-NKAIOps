	"reason": "The system experienced a significant shift in performance after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>,' 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end,' 'Depts only have yunzhanghu,' 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8', and 'getBackupEmp success', exhibit unusual drops in their ranges or mean values. This suggests a potential issue with policy loading, object ID processing, departmental configurations, network traffic, or backup operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate policy loading:** Analyze the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI to identify any errors or bottlenecks in policy application. 2. **Review object ID processing:** Examine the 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPIs to pinpoint potential issues with object ID management and departmental configurations. 3. **Monitor network traffic:** Analyze the 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' KPI to identify any unusual spikes or drops in network traffic that could be impacting performance. 4. **Check backup logs:** Review the logs related to the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with backup operations."
