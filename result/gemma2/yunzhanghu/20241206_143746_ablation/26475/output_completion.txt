	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change.  These include a decrease in the sum of successful requests and an increase in idle CPU time. Additionally, metrics related to network connections and security sessions show unusual fluctuations. This suggests a potential issue with the deployed change affecting system performance and security.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code changes made to identify potential issues causing these anomalies. 2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze logs for error messages or warnings related to the affected services and components. 3. **Review configuration changes:** Check if any configuration changes inadvertently introduced problems. 4. **Rollback the change:** If possible, rollback the recent change to restore the previous state and investigate further. 5. **Test thoroughly:** After addressing the issues, perform thorough testing to ensure the system functions correctly and the anomalies are resolved."
