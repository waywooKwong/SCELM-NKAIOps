{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "1-(node_filesystem_free_bytes{hostname=~"bj3-rd-yos-prod-03",fstype=~"ext4|xfs",mountpoint="/data"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{hostname=~"bj3-rd-yos-prod-03",fstype=~"ext4|xfs",mountpoint="/data"}), node_sockstat_TCP_alloc{hostname=~"bj3-rd-yos-prod-03"}, [GetWeChatUserInfo] GetWeChatUserInf<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:> , node_load1{hostname=~"bj3-rd-yos-prod-02"}, irate(node_disk_read_time_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj3-rd-yos-prod-02"}[1m])",
	"reason": "The system is experiencing performance degradation as indicated by several key performance indicators (KPIs) showing negative changes.  These include a decrease in filesystem free bytes, an increase in TCP allocation,  failures in user information retrieval, higher CPU load, and increased disk read time. These anomalies suggest potential resource contention, network issues, and/or application bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource utilization:** Analyze system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify potential bottlenecks.  2. **Monitor network traffic:**  Examine network traffic patterns to detect any unusual spikes or congestion. 3. **Review application logs:** Analyze application logs for errors or performance issues related to user information retrieval. 4. **Optimize application code:** Identify and address any performance bottlenecks within the application code. 5. **Scale resources:** Consider scaling up system resources (e.g., CPU, memory) if necessary. 6. **Implement caching:** Utilize caching mechanisms to reduce disk read operations and improve application performance."
