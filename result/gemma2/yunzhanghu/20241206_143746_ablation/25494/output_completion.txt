	"reason": "The system shows signs of instability and potential resource contention.  Several key performance indicators (KPIs) have experienced significant changes, indicating potential issues with system load, network connectivity, and disk I/O.  The upward trend in node_load5 and node_load1 suggests increased CPU utilization, while the changes in node_sockstat_TCP_alloc and the filesystem utilization KPI indicate potential network and storage bottlenecks. The increase in the 'securitySessionCheck' failures could be related to session timeouts or authentication issues.",
	"solution": "1. **Monitor system resources closely:** Use tools like `top`, `iostat`, and `netstat` to track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Identify any processes or applications consuming excessive resources. 2. **Optimize application performance:** Review code for potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Consider caching frequently accessed data and optimizing database queries. 3. **Increase system capacity:** If resource utilization consistently exceeds acceptable thresholds, consider upgrading hardware components such as CPU, RAM, or storage. 4. **Investigate network connectivity:** Check for network congestion or slowdowns. Analyze network traffic patterns and optimize routing configurations. 5. **Review security settings:** Ensure that session timeouts are appropriately configured and that authentication mechanisms are secure. Investigate the 'securitySessionCheck' failures to determine the root cause."
