	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected trends and ranges.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to zero, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' exhibit unusual shifts in their ranges, suggesting underlying system or configuration problems. 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' also shows a change in its range, potentially indicating network traffic issues.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue**: Check for errors in policy loading, configuration problems, or potential failures in the policy management system. 2. **Analyze the affected KPIs**: Examine logs, system metrics, and configurations related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' to pinpoint the root cause of their unusual behavior. 3. **Monitor network traffic**:  Track the 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' metric closely to identify any sustained spikes or unusual patterns that might indicate network bottlenecks or issues."
