	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The system experienced a significant shift in performance after the change. Several key metrics, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' which dropped to zero, and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  showed unusual trends indicating potential issues with policy loading, department management, backup operations, and authentication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue. Review the changes made to the system and identify any potential conflicts or errors affecting policy deployment. Analyze the performance degradation in department management, backup operations, and authentication to pinpoint the specific areas requiring attention. Implement necessary fixes and monitor the system closely to ensure stability and performance recovery."
