	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a dramatic decrease in their minimum values, suggesting potential issues with object retrieval or policy loading.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show upward trends in their means, indicating potential performance bottlenecks or authorization issues.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies.  This could involve examining logs, monitoring system resource utilization, and reviewing recent code changes.  Possible solutions might include optimizing database queries, addressing authorization issues, or scaling up resources to handle the increased load."
