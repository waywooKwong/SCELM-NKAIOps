	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in performance metrics after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>','computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message', show drastic changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting a negative impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the specific changes implemented and their potential impact on these KPIs. Review logs and system monitoring data to pinpoint the root cause of the performance degradation. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigating measures to restore normal system behavior."
