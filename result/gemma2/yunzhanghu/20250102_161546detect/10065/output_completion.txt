	"reason": "Several KPIs indicate performance degradation and potential errors. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a decrease in mean value, suggesting possible issues with MySQL connectivity or query execution.  'build', 'superiorAndDeputy empty', and 'approve status error' demonstrate fluctuations in their ranges, hinting at inconsistencies or bottlenecks in the corresponding processes. Additionally, the increasing rate of 'node_load1' indicates potential resource contention on the nodes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the MySQL queries used by 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' to identify potential slowdowns or inefficiencies. Analyze the logs and metrics related to 'build', 'superiorAndDeputy empty', and 'approve status error' to pinpoint the root causes of their fluctuations.  Consider optimizing resource allocation and scaling infrastructure to address the increasing load on nodes indicated by 'node_load1'."
