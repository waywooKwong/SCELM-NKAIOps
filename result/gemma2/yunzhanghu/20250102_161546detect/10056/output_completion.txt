{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  60 , 103",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit upward trends while others like 'message' display unexpected positive shifts. This suggests potential issues with data processing or external factors influencing these metrics.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPIs**: Analyze recent changes in code or configurations related to these functionalities. Identify any new dependencies or potential sources of errors causing the upward trends.\n2. **Review the 'message' KPI**: Examine logs and system events around the time of the positive shift. Look for patterns or error messages that could explain the change in behavior.\n3. **Monitor affected systems closely**: Continuously track the performance of relevant systems and services. Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of any further deviations from expected ranges."
