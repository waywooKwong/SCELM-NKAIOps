	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(getBackupEmp success) , sum(message), sum(AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>), sum(computeOwnObjectIDs end), sum(computeOwnObjectIDs end)",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant deviation from the normal operating range for several KPIs, suggesting potential issues with system performance and functionality.  Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success', 'message', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' are showing increased negative values.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success'.** Analyze log files and system resources to pinpoint any errors or bottlenecks affecting backup operations. 2. **Review the data patterns in 'message' and identify recurring error messages.**  This can help diagnose specific issues within the system. 3. **Examine the performance metrics for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and explore potential optimizations for improving authentication efficiency.** 4. **Analyze the trends in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and check for any resource contention or performance degradation related to object retrieval.** 5.  **Monitor system logs and resource utilization closely to identify any further anomalies or performance degradations.** "
