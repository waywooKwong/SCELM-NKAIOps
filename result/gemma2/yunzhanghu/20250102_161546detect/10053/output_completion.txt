	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal patterns. Several key performance indicators (KPIs) have experienced substantial increases or decreases, suggesting potential issues with resource consumption, system load, or service availability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in the top 5 abnormal KPIs.** This may involve examining logs, monitoring system resource usage, and analyzing application performance metrics.\n2. **Review recent changes to the system or applications** that could have contributed to these deviations. \n3. **Optimize resource allocation** if necessary to ensure that applications have sufficient resources to function properly.\n4. **Implement appropriate monitoring and alerting mechanisms** to detect future anomalies and enable timely responses."
