```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold, indicating no significant deviations from normal operation.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


Let me explain why the response is structured this way:

* **change_type:**  Set to "normal" because the provided data indicates no unusual spikes or drops in metrics that would suggest a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Left empty since there are no identified abnormalities.
* **reason:** Clearly states that the metrics fall within acceptable ranges, implying normal system behavior.
* **solution:**  Omitted because there's no issue to solve.



Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
