	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,computeOwnObjectIDs end,message,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,  36.kpi name",
	"reason": "The analyzed data reveals that several key performance indicators (KPIs) have exhibited significant deviations from their expected behavior post-change implementation. This indicates a potential issue with the introduced changes impacting system stability and performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate specific impacted KPIs**:  Focus on 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 36.kpi name' to pinpoint the root cause of their anomalies. 2. **Review change logs**: Scrutinize the recent changes implemented to identify potential conflicts or unintended consequences that might be affecting these KPIs. 3. **Monitor system resources**: Analyze CPU, memory, and network usage during periods when the anomalies are most prevalent to rule out resource contention issues. 4. **Rollback changes**: If possible, consider reverting the recent changes to a stable state while investigating further.  5. **Test thoroughly**: After resolving the issue, conduct rigorous testing to ensure that the system functions correctly and the KPIs have returned to expected behavior."
