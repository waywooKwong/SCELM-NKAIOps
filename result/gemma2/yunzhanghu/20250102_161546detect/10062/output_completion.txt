{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_memory_rss, approve status error, superiorAndDeputy empty, container_network_receive, container_network_transmit",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges.  'container_memory_rss' shows a higher mean value and wider range after the change, suggesting increased memory consumption. 'approve status error' indicates a decline in approval success rate, potentially due to underlying process issues. 'superiorAndDeputy empty' displays an unexpected downward trend, hinting at potential data inconsistencies or errors in tracking relationships.  Furthermore, 'container_network_receive' and 'container_network_transmit' show anomalies, suggesting network communication problems.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate memory consumption:** Analyze resource usage patterns of containers to identify the cause of increased memory consumption in 'container_memory_rss'. Consider optimizing application code, adjusting container configurations, or scaling resources as needed. 2. **Troubleshoot approval errors:** Examine the 'approve status error' KPI for specific error messages and log entries to pinpoint the root cause of failed approvals. Review workflows, access controls, and system dependencies for potential bottlenecks or misconfigurations. 3. **Validate data integrity:** Scrutinize the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI to ensure accurate data collection and processing. Check for potential data entry errors, synchronization issues between systems, or inconsistencies in relationship definitions. 4. **Monitor network performance:** Analyze network traffic patterns and troubleshoot any anomalies detected in 'container_network_receive' and 'container_network_transmit'.  Check for network congestion, faulty connections, or misconfigured firewalls that could be impacting communication. "
