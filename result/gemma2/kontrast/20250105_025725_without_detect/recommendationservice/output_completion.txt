**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the data shows clear anomalies indicating a potential problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The most significant deviations are in `istio_count`, `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, and `istio_duration`. We've listed these as they seem to be driving the overall change.
* **reason:** The provided explanation highlights the key indicators of a potential failure: increased resource usage (CPU, network), and inconsistent behavior in request counts and durations. 
* **solution:**  The suggested steps are general best practices for addressing performance issues. It's crucial to investigate further based on the specific metrics and logs to identify the root cause.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Marked as "failure" because the provided data clearly indicates a negative shift in performance indicators. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The most concerning KPIs are `istio_count`, `istio_duration`, and `cpu_usage`. These metrics show a downward trend, suggesting potential issues with request handling efficiency and resource consumption.
* **reason:**  The reason for the "failure" classification is based on the observed negative trends in the key performance indicators. A decrease in `cpu_usage` might seem positive, but in this context, it could indicate underutilization or inefficient code execution leading to a decline in overall throughput.  
* **solution:** The proposed solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the performance degradation. Code reviews and application profiling are essential steps in diagnosing and resolving these issues.

}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The data clearly shows a negative shift in key performance indicators, indicating a potential failure or issue. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We list the most impactful KPIs exhibiting anomalies. Note that we exclude "build" related KPIs as they are not directly related to operational performance.
* **reason**:  The analysis provides a concise explanation for the classification as "failure," highlighting the specific metric deviations and their potential implications (resource constraints, service issues).
* **solution**: The suggested actions offer a structured approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Network Analysis:** Focus on understanding why network activity is down.
    2. **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously track CPU usage and identify resource hogs.
    3. **Log Examination:** Look for clues within application logs about potential errors or performance problems.
    4. **Targeted Testing:** Isolate and test services to pinpoint the exact source of the issue.

Let me break down why:

* **change_type: normal:** The provided data indicates that none of the key performance indicators (KPIs) have surpassed their defined thresholds. This suggests that the system is functioning within expected parameters. 

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Since there are no KPIs exceeding their thresholds, this field remains empty.

'istio_count' and 'net_send_packet' also exhibit decreases, suggesting reduced network activity or communication failures. The upward trend in 'istio_duration' might point to increased latency within the service.",
