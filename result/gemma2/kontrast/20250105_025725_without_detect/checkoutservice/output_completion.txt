Let me break down why I chose "normal" based on your provided information:

* **Thresholds:** You mentioned that  "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold," This means the metrics are within acceptable ranges.
* **Absence of Extreme Values:**  There's no mention of any KPIs spiking drastically or behaving erratically.
* **Testing:** The fact that the data has been "tested" implies a deliberate check against expected behavior.

	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": " istio_success_rate, diskio, net_recv_packet,  net_send_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change. 'istio_success_rate' drops drastically, indicating issues with request completion. 'diskio' reduces to zero, suggesting potential disk access problems. 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet' exhibit large fluctuations, implying network connectivity challenges.  'istio_duration' increases, pointing to slower service response times.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'istio_success_rate' decline. Examine disk usage and potential I/O bottlenecks. Analyze network traffic patterns and troubleshoot any connectivity issues. Profile the code for performance improvements to address the increased 'istio_duration'."
