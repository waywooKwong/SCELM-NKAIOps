}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics data clearly indicates a negative impact on system performance after the change.  Both 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' experienced abnormal shifts. 
* **Top 5 KPIs:** While only two KPIs are mentioned as directly affected, it's important to consider other relevant metrics (latency, error rates) that might provide a more complete picture.
* **Reason:** The sudden increase in request count could be due to the change attracting more users or introducing issues that lead to repeated requests. The decrease in success rate points to problems processing these requests efficiently.

**Explanation:**

* **Normal Change:** The analysis states there are no significant deviations in KPIs, and the total number of anomalous KPIs is 0.  The absence of anomalies combined with the lack of specific KPI failures points towards a normal change.

**Explanation:**

The analysis provided states that the total anomalies found are -1 (likely a typo and should be zero) and there are no anomalous KPIs. This means that despite some shifts in the ranges of 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate', the system didn't exhibit any clear signs of failure or abnormal behavior according to its monitoring systems.  

Therefore, classifying this change as "normal" is justified based on the lack of significant performance degradation or error indications.
