{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The analysis indicates no significant anomalies in KPIs related to the service. Metrics like request_count and request_success_rate show minimal changes from pre-change values and remain within historical norms.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 




Let me break down my reasoning:

* **No Anomalies:** The provided data states "Total anomalies found: -1" and "Total number of anomalous kpis: 0". This strongly suggests there were no significant deviations from expected behavior.

* **Minimal KPI Changes:**  The metrics for `request_count` and `request_success_rate` show minimal changes between pre-change and post-change periods, remaining within their typical ranges.

* **Absence of Failures:** The data doesn't mention any system disruptions, increased error rates, or decreased availability â€“ all indicators of a failed change.




Since the metrics remain stable and no anomalies were detected, this points to a successful deployment.

	"reason": "While there are no explicitly stated anomalies in the provided data,  the metrics indicate a potential failure.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics suggest a failure because KPIs like 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' are exhibiting abnormal behavior, even though no explicit anomalies are mentioned.  This indicates potential issues with the change impacting the service's functionality.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * 'request_count':  A sudden shift in request count could indicate problems processing requests or a surge in traffic that the system can't handle.
    * 'request_success_rate': A decrease in success rate points to errors or failures when handling requests, which directly affects user experience.

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs suggests that the change introduced issues affecting how the service handles requests and processes them successfully.

* **Solution:** A multi-pronged approach is needed:
    1. **Code Review:** Examine recent code changes related to 'view_cartpage' for potential bugs or unintended consequences.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Investigate logs for error messages, exceptions, or unusual patterns coinciding with the change implementation. 
    3. **Rollback (if critical):** If the impact is severe and requires immediate action, consider rolling back the recent change to restore previous functionality while investigating the root cause.

	"solution": ""

``` 



Let me break down why this classification was made:

* **No KPI Exceeds Threshold:** The provided data states that  all indicator data remains within expected thresholds. This means there are no immediate signs of performance degradation or system instability.

* **Absence of "Build" KPIs:** The instruction to exclude "build" KPIs from the list of abnormal ones is followed in the output. 

* **Limited Information:** While we know overall trends (e.g., "request_count" is increasing),  specific values and potential deviations from historical norms are missing. More detailed KPI data would help confirm if this change is truly normal or if subtle issues exist.

**Explanation:**

The provided analysis clearly states: "Total anomalies found: 0".  This means there were no significant deviations from expected behavior. Additionally, while one KPI shows an anomaly ("request_success_rate"), it doesn't have a substantial change in its range before and after the change. 

Therefore, based on the absence of overall anomalies and insignificant changes in KPIs, the change is classified as "normal".

	"reason": "The metrics 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' show significant deviations after the change. While the 'request_count' trend remains upward, the mean value decreases slightly.  The 'request_success_rate' remains at 0.0 in both periods, indicating a potential failure in successful request handling.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to the 'view_cartpage' service. Review logging and error reports for clues about why requests might be failing.  Consider rolling back the recent changes or implementing temporary workarounds to restore service stability."
