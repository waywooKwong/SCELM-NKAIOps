}
``` 


Let me break down why I classified this as a failure:

* **Significant Deviations:** The provided data shows considerable shifts in the ranges and averages for several key KPIs after the change. This suggests something substantial happened that impacted the system's behavior.

* **Critical KPIs Affected:**  The affected KPIs (`istio_success_rate`, `net_send_packet`, `istio_duration`, `memory_usage`) are all crucial indicators of service health and performance:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A low success rate indicates problems with message delivery or service functionality.
    * `net_send_packet`:  Changes in packet sending patterns could point to network issues or application-level changes that affect communication.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration suggests delays in processing requests, which can lead to slow response times and user dissatisfaction.
    * `memory_usage`: Higher memory usage might indicate memory leaks or inefficient code that's consuming more resources than necessary.

**Next Steps:**

The provided analysis points to a likely failure scenario. To confirm and resolve the issue, you should:

1. **Deep Dive into Logs:** Examine logs around the time of the change to pinpoint specific error messages, warnings, or unusual events.
2. **Monitor System Resources:**  Track CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and other system metrics closely to identify patterns and potential bottlenecks.
3. **Analyze Application Code:** Review recent code changes to see if any modifications might have inadvertently introduced performance issues or resource-intensive logic.

}
```  


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The large shifts in KPIs like `istio_success_rate`, `cpu_usage`, and `memory_usage` strongly indicate a problem. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: These are the KPIs that show the most drastic changes, likely pointing to the core issues.  
* **reason**: The combination of these KPI changes suggests a malfunctioning code update or misconfigured settings. 
* **solution**: The suggested steps outline a common debugging process for such scenarios:

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi"`**: The selected KPIs show the most drastic changes:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests issues with request handling or communication within the service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration means requests are taking longer, impacting responsiveness.
    * `memory_usage`:  An increase in memory usage could point to inefficient code or resource leaks.
    * `net_send_packet`:  Changes here might indicate network congestion or issues with data transfer.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased CPU utilization suggests the service is under heavy load, potentially due to performance bottlenecks.

* **`"reason"`**: The provided metrics clearly demonstrate a negative impact on the system's performance after the change. 


* **`"solution"`**:  The suggested steps focus on identifying the root cause of the failure and taking corrective action:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Thoroughly investigate logs, resource usage patterns, and application code to pinpoint the exact source of the problems.
    * **Rollback (if applicable):** If a recent change is strongly suspected as the cause, consider reverting it to restore previous stability.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, memory_usage, istio_duration",
	"reason": "There are significant drops in  'istio_success_rate', 'memory_usage', and 'istio_duration' after the change. This suggests a potential issue with service performance or resource consumption.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The data indicates a negative impact on key performance indicators, pointing to a potential failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The KPIs with the most significant drops are prioritized.  'cpu_usage' and 'net_send_packet' show minor changes that might not be as critical as the others. 
* **reason:** The chosen KPIs highlight issues with service reliability ('istio_success_rate'), resource utilization ('memory_usage'), and request processing speed ('istio_duration').
* **solution:**  The suggested steps focus on troubleshooting the identified problems:

    * **'istio_success_rate':** Look for errors in communication between services or misconfigurations within the Istio setup. 
    * **'memory_usage':** Check for memory leaks, inefficient code, or a surge in requests overloading available resources.
    * **'istio_duration':**  Investigate potential bottlenecks in service execution paths, network latency, or database query performance.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_send_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' drops dramatically, 'istio_duration' increases with a downward trend, and 'net_send_packet', 'memory_usage', and 'cpu_usage' exhibit unusual fluctuations. This suggests a potential issue with the system's performance or resource utilization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the abnormal KPI changes.  Examine logs and monitoring data around the time of the change to pinpoint potential bottlenecks or errors. Review the code related to the affected services and configurations for any recent modifications that might have introduced issues." 
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The significant deviations in key KPIs like 'istio_success_rate' and 'istio_duration' strongly indicate a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: These are the KPIs with the most drastic changes, suggesting they are directly impacted by the issue.
* **reason**: The provided explanation details the nature of the deviations and their potential implications for system performance and resource usage. 
* **solution**:  The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Investigate**: Look for patterns in logs and monitoring data around the time of the change.
    2. **Review code**: Examine recent changes to the codebase, particularly those related to the affected services.
    3. **Configuration**:  Check if any recent configuration modifications might be contributing to the problem.
