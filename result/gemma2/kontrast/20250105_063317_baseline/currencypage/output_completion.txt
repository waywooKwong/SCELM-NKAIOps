**Explanation of Reasoning:**

* **Data Range Shifts:** The provided data clearly shows a significant shift in the ranges for both 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.  This indicates a departure from normal behavior.
* **Mean Value Changes:** The drop in the mean value of 'request_count' suggests that fewer requests are being successfully processed, potentially indicating an issue with service availability.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count",
	"reason": "The provided metrics show significant deviations after the change.  'request_duration' exhibits a substantial increase in maximum value and a shift to positive values, while 'request_count' demonstrates a decrease in both minimum and mean values. This indicates potential performance degradation and increased latency.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this period. Focus on areas that might impact request processing time and resource consumption. Review logs for error messages or unusual patterns that could explain the observed anomalies. Consider reverting the change or applying a patch to address the identified issues." 
}
```  



**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The shift in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' metrics strongly suggests a failure. Increased request duration implies slower response times, negatively impacting user experience. Decreased request count could indicate issues with service availability or redirection.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We list 'request_duration' and 'request_count' as the primary culprits due to their significant deviations.  Other KPIs might contribute, but these two directly reflect performance and usage changes.

* **Reason:** The reason for failure is clearly stated: the change introduced code that negatively impacted service responsiveness and potentially reduced its visibility or accessibility.

* **Solution:** The proposed solution emphasizes a systematic approach:
    * **Code Review:** Identify specific code changes responsible for the anomalies.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine logs for error messages, exceptions, or unusual patterns that pinpoint the root cause.
    * **Rollback/Patch:**  Revert the problematic change if possible or apply a fix to address the identified issues.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The significant shifts in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' metrics strongly suggest a failure.  Negative values for duration are especially concerning, implying potential errors or unexpected behavior.

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** We highlight 'request_duration' and 'request_count' as the primary culprits due to their drastic changes post-change.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to issues with how the system handles requests after the change. This could stem from bugs, inefficient code, or resource constraints introduced by the update.

* **Solution:** A combination of code review and log analysis is crucial to pinpoint the exact cause.  Potential solutions include:
    * Reversing the problematic changes if possible.
    * Debugging the affected code to identify and fix errors.
    * Optimizing the code for improved performance and resource utilization.

Let me explain my reasoning:

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly indicates a failure.  The KPIs `request_duration` and `request_count` exhibit abnormal behavior, pointing to a performance degradation. 

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** While there's only one specific anomaly type mentioned ('Single spike'), it's enough for classification as 'failure'. The two most crucial KPIs are `request_duration` and `request_count`, which indicate the system is taking longer to process requests and the number of successful requests has decreased.

* **Reason:** The substantial shift in the ranges of `request_duration` and `request_count` after the change strongly suggests that the change introduced a problem, causing increased processing times and potentially impacting request handling.

* **Solution:** A thorough investigation into the code changes related to the `currencypage` service is essential. This should include:
    * Reviewing any recent modifications that could affect request processing time or error handling.
    * Examining logs for error messages or patterns that coincide with the change and the observed performance degradation.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Significant Data Range Changes:** The 'request_duration' and 'request_count' KPIs show drastically different ranges after the change. This indicates a potential disruption in how requests are handled, leading to either slower processing times or fewer requests being successfully processed. 
* **Negative Trend:**  The "whole trend" is described as "down" for both KPIs. While a downward trend isn't always bad, the sudden and significant shift suggests a problem rather than a natural decline.

**Important Notes:**


* The lack of specific anomaly descriptions ("Sudden increase", etc.) makes it harder to pinpoint the exact nature of the failure.  
* More detailed logging and monitoring data would be helpful for a more precise diagnosis and solution.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs). Specifically, 'request_duration' and 'request_count' exhibit anomalous patterns after the change. The increased range for 'request_duration', going from 0.0 to 26.4534, indicates a potential slowdown or instability in service response times. Similarly, the  reduced range for 'request_count', going from -0.0413 to 26.6582 to -0.4706 to 6.1036, suggests a decrease in user interactions or requests processed.",
	"solution": "Investigate the specific changes made to the 'currencypage' service. Review logs and code to identify the root cause of the abnormal KPI fluctuations. Consider reverting the changes or implementing corrective actions to restore normal system behavior. Additionally, enhance monitoring capabilities to detect similar anomalies in the future."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "[request_duration, request_count]",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from expected behavior.  'request_duration' exhibits an unusually wide range after the change, suggesting performance issues. 'request_count' also shows a shift in trend and reduced range, possibly indicating altered usage patterns or errors.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this update to pinpoint the source of the abnormal metrics. Analyze logs for error messages or unusual activity around the time of the change. Consider rolling back the changes if necessary while further investigation is conducted." 
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided metrics point towards a failure as they show significant deviations from expected behavior.  

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** 
    *  `request_duration`: The increased range and negative minimum value indicate performance problems, likely due to code changes causing delays or processing issues.
    * `request_count`: While the trend shifted upwards, the reduced range suggests potential errors or issues preventing requests from being processed as expected.

* **Reason:** The combination of these metrics strongly suggests that the recent change introduced bugs or inefficiencies into the system. The wide range in `request_duration` highlights performance degradation, and the altered pattern in `request_count` points to potential processing errors.
