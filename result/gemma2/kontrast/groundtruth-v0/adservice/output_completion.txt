**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "normal" because the KPIs didn't show significant deviations or failures.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there were no KPIs that significantly deviated from expected behavior.
* **reason:** The analysis emphasizes that while anomalies were detected, they fall within acceptable operational ranges. There's no evidence of a system failure.
* **solution:** "N/A" because no issues were identified requiring a solution.
