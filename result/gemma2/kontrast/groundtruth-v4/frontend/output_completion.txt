**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs show no significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no KPIs that are significantly abnormal.
* **Reason:** The analysis of KPI changes shows no major red flags. While there are anomalies detected by the SCWARN algorithm, these anomalies don't necessarily point to a failure. They could be within expected ranges or temporary fluctuations.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no failure was identified.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change, indicating a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **'istio_success_rate':** A significant drop suggests issues with communication or processing within the Istio service mesh.
    * **'memory_usage':**  A decrease could indicate memory leaks or inefficient memory allocation after the change.
    * **'istio_duration':** A large increase points to delays in processing requests within the Istio mesh.
    * **'net_send_packet':** A change in this metric could indicate network issues or changes in data transmission patterns.
    * **'cpu_usage':** An increase could suggest the change is placing a heavier load on the system's processing capabilities.

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests the change introduced problems into the system, impacting performance, reliability, and potentially resource utilization.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific reason for the failures in 'istio_success_rate' and 'istio_duration'.
    * **Memory and CPU Optimization:** Addressing potential memory leaks and optimizing CPU usage to prevent resource exhaustion.
    * **Network Monitoring:** Investigating network performance and data transmission patterns to rule out network-related issues.
    * **Change Rollback or Mitigation:**  Depending on the severity and root cause, consider reverting the change or implementing strategies to minimize its negative impact.
