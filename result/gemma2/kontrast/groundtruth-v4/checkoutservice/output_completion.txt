{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, istio_count, cpu_usage, diskio",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped sharply, 'net_send_packet' showed a decrease, and 'cpu_usage' and 'diskio' experienced notable reductions. 'istio_count' also decreased, suggesting potential issues with service communication. These changes indicate a negative impact on system performance and stability.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic decrease indicates problems with service communication and request handling.
    * `net_send_packet`: A decrease suggests reduced network activity, potentially impacting data transfer and service responsiveness.
    * `istio_count`: A reduction in the number of Istio calls could point to issues with service discovery or routing.
    * `cpu_usage`: A significant drop might indicate underutilization of resources or a process issue.
    * `diskio`: A decrease in disk I/O could signal less data access, which might be normal but requires further investigation depending on the service's workload.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes points to a failure in the change. The system is performing worse in key areas like communication, network activity, and resource utilization.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to diagnose the problem:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine the exact cause of the KPI changes.
    * **Code Review:** Examine recent code changes for potential bugs or misconfigurations.
    * **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize logs for error messages and unusual patterns.
    * **Rollback:** If the issue is severe, consider reverting the change to restore stable performance.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" because the KPIs show no significant deviations from expected behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPI:**  Empty because there are no KPIs flagged as significantly abnormal.
* **Reason:** The analysis focuses on KPIs that exceed thresholds or show sudden, unexpected changes. The data presented shows mostly stable or slightly fluctuating KPIs.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Normal" because the KPIs didn't show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** N/A  (Not applicable since the change type is "normal")
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while anomalies were detected, the KPIs themselves remained within acceptable ranges. This suggests the change might not have directly caused a failure, but further investigation into the anomalies is prudent.
* **Solution:** Not applicable as the change is classified as "normal."

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_count' and 'net_recv_packet' showed a downward trend, while 'istio_success_rate' and 'net_send_packet' also decreased. 'diskio'  reached 0, indicating a potential halt in disk activity.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show a clear downward trend and significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most significant changes are `istio_count`, `net_recv_packet`, `istio_success_rate`, `net_send_packet`, and `diskio`. These indicate problems with network communication, service requests, and potential disk access issues.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to the change negatively impacting system performance. The reduced `istio_count` and `net_recv_packet` suggest fewer requests being processed and received. The drop in `istio_success_rate` and `net_send_packet` points to communication failures and reduced data transmission. The `diskio` reaching 0 is a serious concern, potentially indicating a halt in disk activity.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the problem through code review, log analysis, and error investigation.  Rolling back the change or implementing a temporary fix are immediate steps to restore normal system operation.
