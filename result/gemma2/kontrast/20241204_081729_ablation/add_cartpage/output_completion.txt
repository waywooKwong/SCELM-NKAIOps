Additionally, the total number of anomalies found is -1, which suggests a potential data issue rather than a failure.",
	"solution": "None"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" - The metrics provided do not show a clear pattern of degradation or disruption following the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "None" - The data explicitly states "Total number of anomalous kpis: 0".
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while there are some changes in the request_count and request_success_rate, these are within expected ranges and do not indicate a significant failure. The negative anomaly count further suggests a potential data inconsistency rather than a genuine failure.
* **Solution:**  Since the change appears to be normal, no specific solution is required.
