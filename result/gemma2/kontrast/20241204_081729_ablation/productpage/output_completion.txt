**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  Normal
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  None - The provided data does not list any KPIs as abnormal.
* **Reason:** The analysis indicates that the change did not cause any noticeable negative impacts on the system. KPIs remained within acceptable ranges, and there were no new log patterns suggesting issues.
* **Solution:**  Since the change appears to be normal, no immediate solution is required.

	"solution": "Investigate the software changes made during the deployment. Review the logs for any errors or exceptions related to the request processing.  Consider rolling back the changes or implementing a temporary fix to mitigate the impact."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  'failure' because the metrics show a decline in request success rate and an increase in request count, suggesting the change negatively impacted the system.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "request_success_rate, request_count" are the primary KPIs showing abnormal behavior.

* **Reason:** The decrease in `request_success_rate` indicates the software changes are causing failures in handling requests. The increase in `request_count` might be a symptom of the system trying to compensate for these failures.

* **Solution:** 
    * **Investigation:**  Thoroughly examine the code changes made during the deployment to identify the root cause of the issues.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs for error messages, exceptions, or unusual patterns that correlate with the time of the change.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, consider rolling back the changes to restore the system to a stable state while investigating further.
    * **Temporary Fix:** Implement a temporary workaround to mitigate the impact of the failed requests until a permanent solution is found.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Normal" because the KPIs remained within expected ranges and the anomalies detected were transient and recovered. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** "None" because the data doesn't list specific KPIs that were consistently abnormal.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while there were anomalies, they were short-lived and did not cause persistent negative impacts on system performance. The slight fluctuations in KPIs are common and don't necessarily indicate a failure.
* **Solution:**  Since the change appears to be normal, no immediate solutions are required. Continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure the system continues to operate as expected.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly indicate a failure. The decrease in `request_success_rate` and the increase in `request_count` are strong indicators that the change negatively impacted the service.

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** The two most significant KPIs are `request_success_rate` and `request_count`.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests that the change likely introduced bugs or errors that are causing requests to fail more often. The increased `request_count` might indicate that users are retrying failed requests.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the change:
    * **Code Review:** Analyze the code changes made during the deployment to find the source of the errors.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine logs for error messages and patterns that can help pinpoint the problematic code.
    * **Rollback/Hotfix:** Consider rolling back the change to restore the previous working state or implementing a hotfix to address the issue quickly.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly indicate a negative impact. The decrease in 'request_success_rate' means a higher percentage of requests are failing, while the increase in 'request_count' suggests the system is being overloaded or experiencing repeated failures.
* **Top Abnormal KPIs:**  'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' are the most directly affected KPIs.
* **Reason:** The combination of these metrics points to a change that has introduced errors or performance issues in the 'productpage' service.
* **Solution:** A thorough investigation is needed to identify the specific problem. Reviewing logs and code changes around the time of the anomaly is crucial.

	"reason": "The change resulted in a decrease in the 'request_success_rate' and an increase in the 'request_count'. This indicates potential issues with the software or configuration changes. Additionally, the SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies at specific timestamps, suggesting unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. Review the code changes and configuration updates made during the deployment to identify potential bugs or misconfigurations. 2. Analyze the logs from the affected system to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. 3. Roll back the recent changes if necessary and implement a revised version after thorough testing."

{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The 'request_success_rate' KPI exhibits a 'Sudden increase' anomaly after the change, indicating a potential issue with the service's ability to handle requests successfully. This is further supported by the overall trend of the KPI shifting downwards after the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to identify potential causes for the decreased request success rate. Review logs and system performance metrics for any correlations with the anomaly timestamps. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing a temporary fix to restore service stability."
