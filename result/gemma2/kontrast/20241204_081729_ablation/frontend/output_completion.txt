**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the KPIs that show the most drastic changes after the change. 
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on system performance after the change. The decrease in `istio_success_rate` suggests problems with communication between services.  The changes in `net_recv_packet` and `net_send_packet` point to network issues.  
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Pinpointing the exact code changes causing the problems.
    * **Rollback:**  Reverting the changes if the issue is severe and requires immediate action.
    * **Configuration Review:**  Checking network settings, resource allocation, and other configurations related to the frontend service.
    * **Continuous Monitoring:** Keeping a close eye on the KPIs after implementing any fixes to ensure the problem is resolved.
