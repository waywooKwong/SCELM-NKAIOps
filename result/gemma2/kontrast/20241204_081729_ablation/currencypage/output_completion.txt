}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "Failure" because the KPIs  'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations after the change, suggesting a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  While the output doesn't list the top 5, 'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the most significant anomalies based on the descriptions provided.
* **Reason:** The abnormal changes in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' indicate that the change likely introduced inefficiencies or unexpected behavior in the 'currencypage' service, leading to slower response times and potentially higher resource consumption.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic investigation of the code changes, log analysis, and potential rollback or mitigation strategies to address the performance issues.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count", 
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in the 'request_duration' and 'request_count' KPIs.  Post-change, 'request_duration' shows a much wider range with spikes up to 26.6064, indicating potential performance degradation. 'request_count' also exhibits a wider range and a downward trend, suggesting a decrease in service usage.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to identify the root cause of the 'request_duration' and 'request_count' anomalies. Review logs and system performance metrics to pinpoint bottlenecks or resource contention. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing temporary mitigations until the issue is resolved."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly indicate a failure. The significant changes in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' point to a disruption in service behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary indicators of failure.
* **Reason:** The wider range and unusual trends in these KPIs suggest the change negatively impacted system performance and user experience.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the code changes and analyzing system performance to identify and fix the root cause.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary KPIs showing abnormal behavior.
* **Reason:** The drastic change in the ranges of 'request_duration' and 'request_count' after the change strongly suggests that the implemented changes negatively impacted the service's performance.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on immediate rollback, root cause analysis, and iterative testing to resolve the issue.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count", 
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs).  'request_duration' shows a drastic increase in variability, with values now ranging from -0.0858 to 11.8658. 'request_count' also exhibits unusual behavior, with a shift from a downward trend to an upward trend after the change. These deviations suggest the change negatively impacted the service's performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent change:** Immediately revert to the previous state to restore stable service operation. 2. **Thorough Code Review:**  Examine the code changes introduced during the deployment to identify the root cause of the anomalies. 3. **Regression Testing:**  Execute comprehensive regression tests to validate the functionality and performance of the service after resolving the issues. 4. **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Strengthen monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect similar anomalies in the future."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly indicate a failure. The drastic changes in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' point to a significant disruption in the service's expected behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** 'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary culprits due to their significant deviations.
* **Reason:** The change introduced instability and performance degradation, as evidenced by the abnormal KPI values.
* **Solution:** A multi-pronged approach is necessary: rollback to a stable state, code review to identify the issue, regression testing to ensure functionality, and enhanced monitoring to prevent future occurrences.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from the expected behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "request_duration" and "request_count" are the primary KPIs indicating issues.
* **Reason:** The metrics clearly show a negative impact on the system's performance after the change.  The increased 'request_duration' suggests slower response times, and the changes in 'request_count' could indicate problems with request processing or handling.
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions focus on identifying the root cause of the problem through code review, performance testing, and resource monitoring. Depending on the findings, a rollback or remediation strategy might be necessary.
