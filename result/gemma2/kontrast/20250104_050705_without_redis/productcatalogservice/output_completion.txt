**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure** - The significant and negative changes in core metrics point towards a failed change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We list the most impactful KPIs showing abnormal behavior.  
* **reason**: The provided data clearly shows increased memory usage, CPU usage, and decreased disk I/O. This could indicate inefficient code execution or resource contention after the change. The Istio metrics also suggest problems with service mesh performance.
* **solution**: A systematic approach is needed:

    1. **Identify the Change:** Pinpoint the specific code changes implemented around the time of the performance degradation.
    2. **Root Cause Analysis:**  Thoroughly analyze the affected code to understand how it's impacting resource utilization and service mesh behavior.
    3. **Mitigation/Rollback:** If possible, implement fixes in the code to address the identified issues. If a quick resolution is needed, consider rolling back the changes until a stable solution is found.

	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made and identify the source of increased resource consumption. Optimize resource utilization, consider scaling infrastructure if necessary, and monitor system performance closely."

**Explanation:**

* **reason:** The provided data clearly shows a pattern of increased resource usage, suggesting the change might be causing problems.
* **solution:** We suggest a structured approach: 

    1. **Identify the root cause:** Analyze the code changes to pinpoint what's driving the increased resource consumption.
    2. **Optimization:** Look for ways to make the code more efficient and reduce its resource footprint.
    3. **Scaling:** If optimization isn't sufficient, consider scaling up your infrastructure (e.g., adding more servers) to handle the increased load.
    4. **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor system performance after implementing any changes to ensure stability and identify potential issues early on.

Let me break down why this classification was made:

* **Increased Resource Consumption:** The sharp rise in `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `diskio` strongly indicates that the change introduced a performance bottleneck.
* **Service Mesh Impact:**  The changes in `istio_count` and `istio_duration` point to potential problems within the service mesh itself. This could be due to misconfigurations, inefficient routing, or increased load on the mesh components.

**Important Note:** Without access to the specific code changes, this analysis is based on general trends. A thorough investigation would require examining the code and logs for more precise insights into the cause of these anomalies.

}
``` 


Let me break down why I arrived at this conclusion:

* **Decreased Resource Utilization:**  The metrics `memory_usage` and `cpu_usage` show a substantial drop after the change. This suggests that the service is using fewer resources, which could indicate an unintended consequence of the changes or potential issues with resource allocation.
* **Increased `istio_duration`:**  A wider range in `istio_duration` implies that requests are taking longer to be processed. This could point to bottlenecks within the service or communication delays introduced by the changes.

**Important Note:** The provided data lacks context about the expected behavior of these metrics. For a more accurate assessment, we'd need:

* **Baseline Data:**  What were the normal values for these metrics before the change?
* **Service Function:** What does the service do? Understanding its purpose helps interpret the impact of changes on resource usage and performance.

	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to identify the root cause of increased resource consumption. Optimize the code for efficiency and consider scaling resources if necessary."
}
``` 


Let me explain the reasoning:

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics show clear deviations from their previous trends, particularly in `istio_duration`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `diskio`, and `istio_count`. This indicates a problem.

* **Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **`istio_duration`:** A large spike in duration suggests issues with communication or processing within the Istio service mesh. This could be due to misconfigured routing, overloaded components, or network bottlenecks.
    * **`memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `diskio`:**  Increased resource consumption points to the application or system struggling to handle its workload after the change.

    * **`istio_count`:** A significant increase in Istio requests might indicate a misconfigured service mesh or an application making excessive calls to external services. 


* **Suggested Solution:** The immediate priority is to find the source of the problem. This involves:
    * **Code Review:** Carefully analyze the recent code changes for any potential issues causing resource exhaustion or inefficient communication patterns.
    * **Performance Monitoring:**  Use monitoring tools to track key metrics in real-time and pinpoint specific areas experiencing stress. 
    * **Troubleshooting:**  Leverage logs, debugging tools, and Istio's telemetry features to understand the flow of requests and identify bottlenecks.



Once you have identified the root cause, you can implement targeted solutions such as:

* **Code Optimization:** Refactor code to improve efficiency, reduce resource usage, and optimize communication patterns within the system.
* **Resource Scaling:** If necessary, increase the capacity of your infrastructure (e.g., CPU, memory, network) to handle the increased workload.
