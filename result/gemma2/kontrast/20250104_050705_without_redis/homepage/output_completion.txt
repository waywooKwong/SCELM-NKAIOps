{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count", 
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations from pre-change metrics.  'request_success_rate' dropped to 0.0 after the change, indicating a complete failure of successful requests. 'request_count', while showing an increase, could be indicative of failed attempts due to the low success rate.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment and focus on resolving the issues causing the drop in 'request_success_rate'. Additionally, monitor 'request_count' closely to identify any potential overloading or resource exhaustion issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The drastic drop in `request_success_rate` to 0.0  clearly indicates a failure. This suggests the change broke core functionality related to handling requests.
* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** 
    *  `request_success_rate`: This KPI is the primary indicator of failure due to its sharp decline to zero.
    * `request_count`: While this KPI increased, it's likely a result of repeated failed attempts, not successful interactions with the service.

* **Reasoning:** The provided data strongly suggests that the change broke how the homepage service processes requests, leading to a complete loss of successful responses.

**Explanation:**

* **Normal Change:** The analysis states there are no anomalies detected, and the KPIs like `request_success_rate` and `request_count` show fluctuations within acceptable ranges. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPI:**  Since there were no anomalies identified, this field remains empty.
* **Reason:** The metrics data suggests the change did not negatively impact the service's performance.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No KPI Deviations:** The metrics provided don't indicate any significant changes or drops in performance. Both `request_success_rate` and `request_count` show minor fluctuations, but these are within expected bounds for dynamic systems.
* **Absence of Anomalies:**  The analysis explicitly states "Total anomalies found: -1" and "Total number of anomalous kpis: 0". This means the monitoring system didn't detect any unusual patterns or behavior that would suggest a problem.

Since there are no indicators of performance degradation or abnormal behavior, the change is classified as **normal**.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" -  The metrics provided do not show significant degradation in system performance or any clear indication of a failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Not applicable as there were no identified abnormal KPIs based on the data.
* **Reason:** The data suggests that the change did not result in any notable negative impacts on the service's performance. There was a single anomaly detected, but its nature and impact require further investigation.
* **Solution:** Since the change appears to be normal based on the available data, no immediate solution is required. However, it's good practice to monitor the system closely for any unexpected behavior in the coming days. Further analysis of the SCWARN alert might be helpful to understand its cause and potential implications.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'.  These KPIs show a decrease in success rate and an increase in the number of requests, indicating potential issues with the implemented changes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. Review logs and monitoring data around the time of the anomaly (2024-10-07 13:02:00) to pinpoint the root cause. Potential solutions include reverting the problematic changes, identifying and fixing bugs, or optimizing resource allocation."
}
```  


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The significant drop in 'request_success_rate' and increase in 'request_count' clearly indicate a negative impact on system performance. 
* **Top Abnormal KPIs:**  The analysis highlights 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' as the primary culprits.
* **Reason:** The change likely introduced bugs or inefficiencies that cause requests to fail more frequently and increase overall load.
* **Solution:** A methodical investigation, focusing on the code changes and logs around the anomaly time, is crucial. This can help pinpoint the specific issue and guide the appropriate solution (rollback, bug fix, resource optimization).

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs). Specifically, 'request_success_rate' dropped to 0.0 after the change, indicating a complete failure in successful requests.  Additionally, 'request_count' showed unexpected fluctuations, increasing from 0.0 to -1.7692. These anomalies suggest that the change introduced errors or disruptions in the homepage service.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this deployment to identify the root cause of these KPI deviations. Review logs for any error messages or unusual patterns that occurred around the time of the change.  Roll back the change if possible, and implement a thorough testing process before deploying any further updates."

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in the `request_success_rate` and an increase in the `request_count`.  This indicates that the service is experiencing issues handling requests, leading to lower success rates and potentially increased load on the system.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this deployment. Identify potential issues causing the decreased success rate and consider implementing strategies to optimize request handling, such as: \n* Load balancing:\n Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to reduce the load on individual instances.\n * Caching:\n Store frequently accessed data in memory to speed up response times.\n * Database optimization:\n Ensure the database is performing efficiently by tuning queries and indexing tables."
