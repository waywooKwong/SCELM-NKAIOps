**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: "failure" because the metrics clearly show abnormal behavior after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs**: We focus on the most impactful ones: `request_duration` and `request_count`. These are directly related to system performance and user experience.
* **Reason**: The wide range and extreme values in `request_duration` point to potential performance bottlenecks or issues with request handling. The drastic decrease in `request_count` suggests a problem with how requests are being processed or received, possibly indicating a service unavailability issue.
* **Solution**: 

    1. **Code Review:** Examine the code changes made during the deployment for any logical errors or unintended consequences that could be causing these issues.
    2. **Log Analysis:**  Thoroughly review system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns around the time of the change and when the anomalies occur. This can provide valuable clues about the source of the problem.
    3. **Rollback (if possible):** If the impact is severe and immediate, consider reverting the recent changes to restore previous functionality while you investigate the root cause.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in KPIs. 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show unusual increases after the change, indicating potential performance issues or unexpected traffic spikes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this deployment to identify the root cause of these increased durations and counts. Review logs for errors or warnings around the time of the anomaly. Consider rolling back the change if the issue cannot be quickly resolved." 
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The significant changes in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' after the change strongly suggest a failure.  The dramatic increase in both metrics points to potential performance degradation or unexpected resource consumption.

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:**  'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary KPIs showing abnormal behavior.
* **Reasoning:** The sudden upward shift in these metrics after the change indicates that something introduced by the deployment is causing requests to take longer to process and/or increasing the volume of requests significantly.

* **Suggested Solution:** A thorough investigation into the code changes made during this deployment is crucial. Log analysis can provide insights into potential error messages, warnings, or unusual events occurring around the time of the anomaly.  If a clear cause is identified quickly, a fix can be implemented. If the issue is complex or cannot be resolved immediately, rolling back the change might be necessary to restore stability.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided metrics clearly indicate a failure because 'request_duration' increased dramatically and 'request_count' decreased significantly after the change. This points towards performance degradation and potential disruptions in service availability.

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** 
    *  'request_duration': A large increase in average request duration suggests the service is taking much longer to process requests, likely impacting user experience.
    * 'request_count': A significant decrease in requests indicates fewer users are interacting with the service, which could be due to issues preventing access or discouraging usage.

* **Reason:** The  abnormal behavior of these KPIs directly correlates with a negative impact on the 'currencypage' service. Users likely experience slow loading times and may encounter difficulties accessing the page altogether.

	"solution": null
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No KPI Deviations:** The metrics `request_duration` and `request_count`, while showing changes in their ranges, do not exhibit a significant deviation from their pre-change behavior.  The fact that the ranges are smaller after the change suggests potential improvements rather than failures.
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The absence of anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm indicates that the system's monitoring tools did not identify any unexpected patterns or deviations caused by the change.




Remember, if you were to see significant spikes in error rates, latency, or a decrease in uptime along with clear anomaly patterns, that would point towards a "failure" classification and require further investigation for solutions.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**:  'failure' because the KPIs 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations from their normal behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  While the data only provides two clear anomalies, 'request_duration' and 'request_count', it's important to note that other KPIs might be affected indirectly. The analysis should investigate further.
* **Reason**: The extreme negative values in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' suggest a problem with how the service is processing requests. This could be due to errors in the code, resource limitations, or external factors.
* **Solution**: The proposed steps focus on identifying the root cause of the anomalies through code review, debugging, and resource monitoring.  Reverting changes if possible can help quickly stabilize the situation.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: "failure" - The significant deviations in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' clearly point towards a negative impact on the service.  
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We only list two KPIs as they are directly responsible for the failure classification, according to your provided data.
* **Reason**: The analysis of pre-change and post-change KPI data reveals a concerning trend: 'request_duration' increasing significantly while 'request_count' decreasing sharply. This combination suggests that although fewer requests are being handled, those that are being processed are taking substantially longer, indicating a performance bottleneck or issue within the service.
* **Solution**: The suggested solution focuses on pinpointing the source of the problem by examining recent code changes related to the 'currencypage' service.  Specific areas for investigation include database interactions (for slow queries), caching strategies (to ensure data is readily available), and any new logic that might be causing increased processing overhead.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics data clearly indicates a failure.  The significant changes in request_duration and request_count point to a negative impact on system performance.

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** "request_duration" and "request_count" are the most critical as they directly reflect application responsiveness and user experience. 
* **Reasoning:** The wide range increase in "request_duration" suggests that requests are taking significantly longer to process, potentially due to inefficient code or resource contention. The shift in "request_count," particularly the lower average values, could indicate issues with request handling or unexpected service behavior.

* **Solution:** 
    * **Code Review:** Carefully review the recent changes introduced during this update.  Look for areas where efficiency might have been compromised or unintended side effects might have occurred.
    * **Logging Analysis:** Examine the application logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that coincide with the time of the change. Logs can provide valuable insights into what is causing the performance issues. 
    * **Performance Monitoring:** Continue to monitor key metrics closely after implementing any changes. Use profiling tools if necessary to identify specific bottlenecks within the code.

    * **'request_count':** The decreased range and lower mean value suggest a potential decline in the number of successful requests being handled.

* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies points to a possible bug introduced by the recent change, leading to slower response times and potentially reduced service availability.

	"solution": ""
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No KPI Deviations:** The data shows that while KPIs like 'request_duration' and 'request_count' have changed, these changes fall within normal operational ranges. There are no sudden spikes, drops, or sustained shifts outside of historical norms.
* **Limited Anomaly Data:**  The analysis mentions some anomalies detected by the SCWARN algorithm, but the descriptions lack specifics about which KPIs were affected. Without details on the types and severity of these anomalies, it's impossible to conclude they were caused by the change or significantly impacted service performance. 

* **Absence of New Log Patterns:** The mention of a "newly generated log pattern" is concerning, but without details about this pattern (e.g., its content, frequency), it's difficult to assess its impact. It could be benign or indicative of an issue.




**Recommendation:**

To make a more confident assessment, I would need:

1. **Detailed Anomaly Reports:**  Information on the exact KPIs affected by each SCWARN anomaly, their severity, and the timestamps involved.
2. **Log Pattern Analysis:** A deeper dive into the "newly generated log pattern," including examples of the logs, their frequency, and potential causes.

**Explanation:**

* **No Anomalies Detected:** The analysis explicitly states there are no anomalies found, even though some KPIs like `request_duration` have unusual values.
* **Data Interpretation:**  While the ranges for `request_duration` and `request_count` changed after the update, this doesn't automatically signify a failure. 
    *  The data is insufficient to determine if these changes are significant enough to impact service performance.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided metrics data does not indicate any significant deviations or anomalies.

Additionally, the SCWARN algorithm did not identify any anomalies.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: 'normal' because the metrics data shows no significant deviations from expected behavior. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: N/A as there are no identified abnormal KPIs.
* **Reason**: The analysis of  `request_duration` and `request_count`  indicates that they stayed within expected ranges. The absence of error reports and system downtime further supports the conclusion that the change did not negatively impact system performance. The SCWARN algorithm also failed to flag any anomalies, reinforcing the normal operation status.
* **Solution**: N/A as there are no issues to address.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs).  'request_duration' and 'request_count' show drastic shifts in their ranges after the change. This indicates potential issues with service performance, latency, and resource utilization.",

Review logs for error messages or patterns that correlate with the abnormal behavior. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing targeted fixes to restore normal service operation."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly shows anomalies in critical KPIs like 'request_duration' and 'request_count'. These deviations are significant enough to classify this change as a failure.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPI:** We focus on the most impactful anomalies, which appear to be 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.  Other KPIs may be affected, but these two are directly tied to service performance and user experience.

* **Reason:** The drastically shifted ranges of 'request_duration' and 'request_count' point to problems with the service handling requests. This could be due to inefficient code, resource bottlenecks, database issues, or other underlying factors introduced by the change. 

* **Solution:**  A systematic approach is needed:
    1. **Code Review:** Examine the specific changes made during the submission to identify potential errors or areas where performance might have been negatively impacted.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Thoroughly review logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that coincide with the time of the KPI anomalies. Logs can provide valuable clues about the root cause.
    3. **Rollback:** If the issue is severe and impacting users, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous stable state while further investigation takes place.
    4. **Targeted Fixes:** Once the root cause is identified, implement targeted fixes to address the performance problems. This might involve optimizing code, adjusting resource allocation, or resolving underlying infrastructure issues.
