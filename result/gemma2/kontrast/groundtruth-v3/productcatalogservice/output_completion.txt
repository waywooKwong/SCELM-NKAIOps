**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no significant performance issues.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no KPIs that are significantly abnormal.
* **reason:** The analysis emphasizes that the KPIs are stable, and the SCWARN anomalies, while present, don't point to a failed change based on the given information.
* **solution:**  "N/A" because there are no issues to solve.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant changes in memory usage, CPU usage, istio metrics, and diskio point to a negative impact on the system's performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The list prioritizes the KPIs with the most drastic changes.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly indicates a shift in system behavior after the change, with several KPIs moving outside their normal ranges. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Review Changes:** Understand what was altered in the productcatalogservice.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine logs around the time of the anomalies for specific error messages or patterns.
    * **Performance Tuning:**  Focus on optimizing resource usage (memory, CPU) and addressing potential performance bottlenecks in the code.
    * **Configuration Review:** Ensure that all configurations related to the service are correct and haven't been inadvertently changed.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" - The significant decrease in CPU usage, memory usage, diskio, and net_send_packet, coupled with a substantial increase in istio_duration, strongly suggests a negative impact on the service's performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The listed KPIs show the most drastic changes after the change.
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these KPI changes points to a potential issue with the deployed change. Decreased resource utilization could indicate a problem with the service itself or its interactions with other components. The increased istio_duration suggests potential issues within the service mesh, leading to higher latency.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify why resources are being used less and if the service is functioning correctly.
    * **Istio Optimization:**  Investigate the increased istio_duration to pinpoint bottlenecks or misconfigurations within the service mesh.
    * **Rollback or Mitigation:** Depending on the findings, consider rolling back the change or implementing strategies to mitigate the performance degradation.
