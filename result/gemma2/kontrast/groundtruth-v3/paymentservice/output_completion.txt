{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates no significant deviations in KPIs after the change.  While some KPIs show changes in range, they remain within expected bounds and there are no indications of system degradation or failure.  Additionally, the 'newly generated log pattern' is not described in detail, so its impact cannot be assessed.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations or failures reported.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no KPIs identified as significantly abnormal.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights that the changes in KPI ranges are not indicative of a failure. The absence of detailed information about the "newly generated log pattern" prevents a more conclusive assessment.
* **solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant negative changes after the update.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs reflect the most significant deviations from normal behavior. 
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed KPI changes and their potential impact on system performance. The mention of SCWARN anomalies strengthens the case for a failure.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution provides a structured approach to troubleshooting the issue, emphasizing root cause analysis, log review, and potential mitigation strategies.
