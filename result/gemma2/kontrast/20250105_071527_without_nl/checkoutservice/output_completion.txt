**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The presence of "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" as a flagged anomaly strongly points towards a failure. This indicates that the software change introduced issues causing resource conflicts within the system.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" is the primary anomaly driving this classification.

* **Reason:** The anomaly suggests the new code is not managing system resources effectively, leading to contention. This can manifest as slowdowns, errors, and instability.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the problematic code, optimizing its resource usage, and monitoring the system's performance after implementing changes.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **SCWARN Anomalies:** The provided data explicitly states that the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies during the change window. This strongly suggests a problem, as SCWARN is designed to flag deviations from expected behavior.

* **KPI Degradation:**  The listed anomalies (increased latency, error rate, reduced throughput, connection timeouts, and slower database queries) all point towards a decline in service performance.

```




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Normal Change Classification:** The data indicates that all key performance indicators (KPIs) are within acceptable thresholds.  There's no mention of sustained degradation in latency, error rates, uptime, or throughput.

* **SCWARN Anomaly Handling:** While the SCWARN algorithm did flag an anomaly at a specific timestamp, it's crucial to remember that isolated anomalies don't necessarily equate to a failure. Systems can experience temporary spikes or fluctuations. The absence of persistent negative effects on KPIs suggests this anomaly was likely transient and self-resolved.



* **Lack of Comprehensive KPI Data:**

The analysis doesn't provide detailed pre-change and post-change KPI values. To make a more definitive judgment, it would be helpful to compare the metrics directly before and after the change.

Let me break down why this classification was made:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`**  -  The core principle here is that the change, despite having detected anomalies, didn't lead to any measurable negative impact on system performance. All KPIs stayed within acceptable ranges.

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: "N/A"`** - Since there were no persistent KPI deviations, listing top abnormalities isn't necessary. The SCWARN alerts likely point to areas for further investigation, but not immediate action.

* **`reason`**: This reason highlights the key takeaway: transient anomalies don't necessarily equate to a failed change. The system functioned normally despite these brief events.

``` 

**Explanation:**


* The `Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes` metric flagged by SCWARN directly indicates a problem. Resource contention suggests that system resources (CPU, memory, etc.) are being overused or there's competition for limited resources. This often points to inefficient code or misconfigured systems.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal"  The analysis shows no consistent KPI deviations and only one isolated anomaly detected by SCWARN.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Empty because no KPIs persistently exceeded thresholds.
* **Reason:** While a single anomaly was flagged, the overall performance metrics suggest normal operation. The lack of sustained deviations indicates this might be a transient event rather than a systemic issue.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Anomaly Detection:** The core indicator is the "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" anomaly. This directly points to a problem with how the software uses system resources, which almost always leads to performance issues.

* **Impact on System Performance:** While we don't have specific KPI values, the presence of this type of anomaly heavily suggests that other KPIs like latency, throughput, and error rates have likely been negatively impacted.

}
```


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: "failure" because the SCWARN algorithm, which is designed to detect anomalies, flagged issues during the specific time period. 

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  While you requested to exclude KPIs with "build" in their names, the provided information only mentions the SCWARN algorithm identifying anomalies at two timestamps. This suggests that the core issue lies in the change itself and not a specific KPI exceeding its threshold.  We list the timestamp anomalies as they are the primary indicator of failure. 

* **Reason**: The SCWARN alerts directly point to potential problems introduced by the change. Anomalies usually indicate deviations from expected behavior, which could be performance degradation, unexpected errors, or resource consumption spikes.

* **Solution**: A systematic investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause:
    * **Log Review:** Examine logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity patterns coinciding with the anomaly times.
    * **Code Analysis:**  Scrutinize recent code changes made around the time of the anomalies. Look for potential bugs, logic errors, or unintended consequences.
    * **Configuration Checks:** Verify that system configurations related to the affected service haven't been inadvertently altered during the change process.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Not Available (SCWARN algorithm identifies anomalies at timestamp)",
	"reason": "While overall KPI data might be within expected ranges, the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies at a specific timestamp (2024-10-07 13:02:00). This indicates potential unexpected behavior or performance degradation during that period. Further investigation into the SCWARN alerts is crucial to identify the root cause and affected KPIs.",

}
```




**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** 'failure' because the SCWARN algorithm flagged an anomaly, suggesting a deviation from expected behavior. This points towards a potential issue that needs addressing.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** 'Not Available (SCWARN algorithm identifies anomalies at timestamp)' because the provided information only mentions the timestamp of the anomaly, not specific KPIs affected.

* **Reason:**  The SCWARN alert indicates an unexpected event during the change, even if overall KPIs appear normal. Further investigation is needed to understand the nature and impact of this anomaly.

* **Solution:** The recommended solution involves a detailed investigation into the SCWARN alert, focusing on logs and system metrics around the time of the anomaly (2024-10-07 13:02:00).  This will help pinpoint the root cause and allow for targeted solutions to address the problem.

```


**Explanation:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`**: The anomaly detection by SCWARN and the described KPI deviations strongly suggest a failure. 

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Latency, Error Rate, Throughput"`**: These KPIs are commonly affected when a system experiences performance issues.

* **`"reason"`**: We have both automated anomaly detection (SCWARN) and manual observation of unusual data patterns indicating a performance problem.

* **`"solution"`**: The suggested steps focus on:
    * **Pinpointing the exact time:** Investigating logs around 13:02:00 will help narrow down the cause.
    * **Analyzing new log patterns:** These might reveal specific errors or events related to the failure.
    * **Reviewing recent changes:**  Identify if any code updates or configuration modifications coincided with the issue.

}
```




**Explanation:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`**: The SCWARN algorithm's detection of anomalies strongly indicates a failure scenario. 

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi"`**: While the prompt asks for top 5 KPIs, the provided data only highlights a specific timestamp (2024-10-07 13:02:00) flagged by SCWARN as anomalous.  This suggests a broader system-level issue rather than isolated KPI deviations.

* **`"reason"`**: The anomaly detection directly points to the change causing problems, impacting system stability.

* **`"solution"`**: A thorough investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause and then apply appropriate corrective actions. This may involve reviewing logs, tracing application flow during the anomalous period, and analyzing infrastructure performance metrics.
