**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs largely stayed within expected ranges, and the anomalies that occurred were short-lived and recovered.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there were no persistent abnormal KPIs identified.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that the changes did not lead to sustained performance degradation. The single spike anomalies, while flagged, were transient and did not cause lasting issues.
* **Solution:**  "N/A" because no failures or persistent issues were identified requiring a solution.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights several KPIs with abnormal changes:
    * `net_send_packet`:  Increased range and trend, suggesting network communication issues.
    * `diskio`:  Significant decrease in range, potentially indicating disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `istio_count`:  Large increase in range, likely related to increased load on the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`:  Increased range and downward trend, pointing to performance issues within the Istio service mesh.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased range, suggesting potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a failure in the change implementation. The system's performance has degraded, indicating potential issues with network communication, disk I/O, and resource management.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes, focusing on areas related to the affected KPIs.  Reviewing logs and system events can provide valuable insights into the root cause.  Rolling back the changes or implementing temporary mitigations are recommended to restore system stability.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) like `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, and `istio_duration` point towards a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We've selected the three most impactful KPIs:
    * `net_send_packet`:  A significant increase suggests network traffic spikes.
    * `diskio`:  Increased disk activity could indicate issues with storage performance or log file growth.
    * `istio_duration`:  Higher latency in the Istio service mesh can lead to application slowdowns.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly shows that the changes have led to a noticeable performance degradation. The increased network traffic, disk activity, and latency are all indicative of a system struggling to cope with the new state.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of these performance issues. This involves a combination of code reviews, resource monitoring, and performance testing to pinpoint the exact source of the problem.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    *  `net_send_packet`:  Shows a large increase in range, suggesting network issues.
    * `diskio`:  Shows a slight increase, indicating potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `memory_usage`:  Shows a wider range, indicating potential memory pressure.
    * `istio_count`: Shows a large increase in range, suggesting potential issues with the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: Shows a large increase in range, indicating potential slowdowns in Istio requests. 

* **Reason:** The substantial changes in these KPIs, coupled with the SCWARN anomaly detection, strongly suggest that the change introduced problems.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the specific code changes that were made and how they might be affecting the KPIs.
    * **Reversal:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the system to its previous state.
    * **Corrective Measures:** If reverting is not feasible, implement specific fixes to address the identified issues.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor the KPIs after implementing any solutions to ensure the problem is resolved and performance is stable.
