Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Review the change logs:** Carefully examine the changes made before the observed anomalies to identify any potential code modifications or configuration updates that might have impacted these KPIs.\n2. **Monitor system resources:** Check the resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) of the affected services to see if there are any signs of resource contention or overload.\n3. **Analyze logs:** Investigate the logs of the affected services for any error messages or unusual patterns that might provide clues about the root cause.\n4. **Conduct performance testing:** Run targeted performance tests to assess the impact of the change on the system's responsiveness and throughput.\n5. **Rollback the change:** If possible, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state and observe if the anomalies disappear.
