	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code changes implemented to pinpoint the specific modifications that might be causing these performance regressions. 2. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement more detailed logging and monitoring around the affected areas to gather more granular insights into the issues. This can help identify bottlenecks, errors, or unexpected behavior. 3. **Regression Testing:**  Conduct thorough regression testing to ensure that the changes haven't introduced unintended side effects or broken existing functionality. 4. **Performance Tuning:**  If performance issues are identified, explore potential performance tuning options for the affected code or system components. This might involve optimizing database queries, reducing memory usage, or improving caching strategies. 5. **Rollback:** If the issues are severe and cannot be quickly resolved, consider rolling back the changes to the previous stable state while investigating the root cause further."
