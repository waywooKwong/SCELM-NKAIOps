**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the provided data indicates a negative change in system performance and behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The top 5 KPIs with the most significant deviations are listed.  
* **reason:** The provided metrics suggest several potential issues:
    * **Network Traffic Spike:** The 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{...}))' KPI shows a sharp increase, indicating a potential network bottleneck or unexpected data transfer.
    * **Policy Loading Issues:** KPIs like 'loaded policy count' suggest problems with loading policies, potentially impacting application functionality.
    * **Build Process Problems:** The 'build' KPIs indicate changes in build performance, which could be related to code changes or infrastructure issues.
* **solution:** The suggested solutions aim to address the identified problems:
    * **Network Traffic Investigation:**  Analyze network logs and metrics to understand the cause of the increased traffic.
    * **Policy Loading Review:**  Examine logs and system behavior related to policy loading to identify and fix errors.

	"solution": "1. **Investigate the top 5 abnormal KPIs**: Analyze the specific metrics and trends within these KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the issues. 2. **Review the change logs**: Examine the changes made during the update process to identify any potential conflicts or unintended consequences. 3. **Monitor system resources**: Closely monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network traffic to identify any resource bottlenecks. 4. **Analyze application logs**: Check application logs for any error messages or performance warnings that might shed light on the problems. 5. **Rollback the update**: If the issues are severe, consider rolling back the update to the previous stable version. 6. **Test and validate**: After addressing the issues, thoroughly test and validate the system to ensure that it functions correctly and meets performance requirements."
