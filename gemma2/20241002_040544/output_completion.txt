	"reason": "The data ranges of several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly changed after the modification. KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~"4..",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and 'callback status error' show a dramatic decrease in their maximum values and mean values, indicating a potential issue with request handling or error rates. Other KPIs like 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' and 'get metadata from header' also exhibit unusual shifts in their ranges. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code changes made to identify the potential root cause of the observed anomalies. Pay attention to any modifications related to request handling, error logging, or data retrieval. \n2. **Monitor logs and system metrics:** Analyze logs and system metrics related to the affected services to gain further insights into the behavior of the system after the change. Look for error messages, performance bottlenecks, or unusual resource consumption patterns.\n3. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. This will allow you to isolate the problematic changes and investigate them further.\n4. **Test and validate:** After identifying and addressing the root cause, thoroughly test and validate the system to ensure that the anomalies have been resolved and that the system is functioning as expected."

	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the change, indicating potential issues. For example, KPI 42 shows a drastic decrease in mean value and a narrower range, suggesting a decline in request rate. Similarly, KPIs 43, 46, 47, and 50 exhibit notable shifts in their data distributions, pointing towards potential problems in module performance, metadata retrieval, build process, and client environment handling.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the changes in KPI 42 by analyzing logs and system metrics related to requests handled by the 'be/yid' service. \n2. Review the code and configuration changes related to KPIs 43, 46, 47, and 50 to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences. \n3. Monitor the affected systems closely and collect more data to understand the impact of the changes. \n4. Roll back the changes if necessary and implement the fixes after thorough testing."
