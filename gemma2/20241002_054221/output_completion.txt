	"reason": "The data ranges of several key KPIs have significantly changed after the modification. For example, 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' has a much smaller range after the change, indicating a potential decrease in request volume or processing efficiency. Similarly, 'kpi name: <:list modules:>' and 'kpi name: callback status error' show reduced data ranges, suggesting potential issues with module performance or error handling.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made to identify the potential root cause of the data range shifts. 2. **Monitor key metrics:** Continuously monitor the affected KPIs and other relevant metrics to track the impact of the changes and identify any emerging patterns. 3. **Implement logging and debugging:** Enhance logging and debugging capabilities to gain deeper insights into the system behavior and pinpoint the exact location of the issue. 4. **Rollback or revert changes:** If the anomalies are severe and cannot be quickly resolved, consider rolling back or reverting the recent changes to restore the system to a stable state. 5. **Test and validate:** Thoroughly test and validate any proposed solutions before deploying them to production to ensure they effectively address the identified issues."

	"reason": "The data analysis shows that several key performance indicators (KPIs) have exhibited significant deviations from their expected ranges after the change. This includes a decrease in the average rate of successful requests (KPI 42), a narrowing of the range for module performance (KPI 43), and an increase in errors for callback status (KPI 44). Additionally, KPIs related to employee updates (KPI 45) and ClientEnvHandler (KPI 50) have also shown abnormal behavior. These anomalies suggest potential issues with the implementation or configuration changes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced with the change to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences affecting the affected KPIs. 2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze system logs for any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into the root cause of the anomalies. 3. **Check resource utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to ensure that the system resources are sufficient to handle the increased workload or any changes in traffic patterns. 4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting critical functionality, consider rolling back the changes to the previous stable state while further investigation is conducted. 5. **Test and refine:** After identifying and addressing the root cause, thoroughly test the changes to ensure that the KPIs are functioning as expected and that the system is stable."
