{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "Most KPIs show a downward trend after the change, which is generally expected for performance optimizations. Some KPIs like irate(node_network_receive_bytes_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-bkverify-prod-03",device!~"tap.*|veth.*|br.*|docker.*|virbr*|lo*"}[5m])*8 show an upward trend, indicating potential improvements in network reception. Overall, the data suggests a positive impact of the change.",
	"solution": "Continue monitoring the KPIs closely to ensure the positive trends continue and identify any potential issues that may arise."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

1. **Change Type:** The data suggests a "normal" change. While some KPIs show a decrease and others show an increase, the overall trend appears to be positive, indicating the change likely had a beneficial effect. 

2. **Reason:**
    * **Downward Trends:** Many KPIs like CPU idle time, memory usage, and disk read/write times show a decrease after the change, which aligns with performance improvements.
    * **Upward Trend:** The increase in `irate(node_network_receive_bytes_total)` suggests the change might have positively impacted network reception.
    * **No Significant Outliers:** There aren't any dramatic or unexpected shifts in the data that would point to a failure.

3. **Solution:**  Continuous monitoring is key.  Keep a close eye on the KPIs to:
    * **Confirm Positive Trends:** Ensure the positive trends continue over time.
    * **Detect Any Issues:**  Identify any new problems or unexpected changes in behavior that might require further investigation or adjustments.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided KPI data shows mixed results, with some KPIs indicating improvements (e.g., node_filesystem_free_bytes, irate(node_disk_reads_completed_total)) and others showing no significant change or minor variations.  Overall, the data does not present a clear pattern of failure.",
	"solution": "Further analysis is required to understand the specific trends and potential impacts of these changes. Consider: \n\n* **Correlating KPIs:** Investigate if changes in one KPI are correlated with changes in others.\n* **Monitoring Over Time:** Track KPI performance over a longer period to identify sustained trends.\n* **Contextual Analysis:**  Examine the changes in the context of other system metrics, application logs, and user feedback."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" because the data doesn't conclusively point to a failure. There are both positive and neutral changes.
* **Reason:** The KPIs show mixed results. Some metrics improved (like node_filesystem_free_bytes), some stayed relatively the same, and a few had minor variations. This lack of a consistent negative trend prevents us from classifying it as a failure.
* **Solution:** Instead of jumping to a solution, we recommend further investigation.  The suggested steps help pinpoint the root cause of any potential issues:
    * **Correlation:** See if changes in one KPI are linked to changes in others. This can reveal dependencies.
    * **Long-Term Monitoring:**  A longer view of the data might reveal patterns that aren't obvious in a short snapshot.
    * **Contextual Analysis:**  Look at other system metrics, logs, and user reports to understand the bigger picture. This helps determine if the KPI changes are significant or just noise.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed trends for different KPIs. Some KPIs indicate improvements (e.g., 73.kpi name: 1-avg(irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-bkverify-prod-01", mode=~"idle"}[2m])) by (mode, hostname)), while others show deteriorations (e.g., 78.kpi name: pyroscope upload profile: do http <:RequestPost:>).  This suggests the change might have had both positive and negative impacts on the system, and further investigation is needed to understand the full scope.",
	"solution": "To determine the overall impact of the change, analyze the trends of KPIs related to the specific functionality affected. Investigate the reasons behind the negative trends and explore potential mitigation strategies. Monitor the system performance closely after the change and adjust accordingly."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" - The data doesn't conclusively point to a failure. There are both positive and negative changes in different KPIs.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the mixed nature of the changes. Some KPIs improved, indicating potential benefits, while others worsened, suggesting potential drawbacks. This mixed bag makes it difficult to definitively call the change a failure.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a more in-depth analysis:
    * **Focus on Relevant KPIs:**  Don't just look at all KPIs. Identify those most relevant to the functionality impacted by the change.
    * **Investigate Negative Trends:** Dig into the reasons behind the KPIs that worsened. This could involve examining logs, system configurations, or user feedback.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Based on the investigation, develop strategies to address the negative trends and minimize their impact.
    * **Continued Monitoring:**  Keep a close eye on the system's performance after the change. Be prepared to make further adjustments if needed.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in the distribution of several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This suggests that the change may have introduced unintended consequences or vulnerabilities. For example, KPIs like 'xfs' and 'probe_duration_seconds' show a downward trend in mean values and a narrowing of the data range after the change, indicating potential performance degradation. Additionally, KPIs like 'irate(node_disk_reads_completed_total)' exhibit a change in trend direction, suggesting instability in disk read operations.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This could involve: \n\n* **Reviewing the change logs:** Analyze the specific modifications made during the change implementation to identify potential sources of error or unintended side effects.\n* **Monitoring system resources:**  Closely monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and disk I/O to identify any resource bottlenecks or unusual patterns that may be contributing to the performance issues.\n* **Conducting load testing:**  Simulate realistic workloads to assess the system's capacity and identify any performance limitations introduced by the change.\n* **Analyzing application logs:** Examine application logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity that may shed light on the root cause of the anomalies.\n\nBased on the findings of the investigation, appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate the negative impact of the change and restore system stability."

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed trends for KPIs before and after the change. Some KPIs show improvements, while others show deteriorations. Overall, there isn't a clear indication of a negative impact on the system.",
	"solution": "Continue monitoring the KPIs and analyze the trends over a longer period to identify any persistent negative impacts. Investigate any specific KPIs that show significant deviations from expected behavior."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "normal" because the data doesn't clearly point to a failure. There are both positive and negative changes in KPIs.

* **reason:** The data analysis shows mixed results. Some KPIs improved after the change, while others worsened. This suggests the change might have had both positive and negative effects, making it difficult to conclude a definite failure.

* **solution:**  Continuous monitoring is key.  
    * **Long-term trend analysis:** Track KPIs over a longer period to see if any negative trends become more apparent.
    * **Deep dive:** Investigate KPIs that show significant deviations from expected behavior. This could involve looking at logs, system configurations, and user activity to understand the root cause of the changes.
