	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their data ranges after the change.  For example, 'GIN' shifted from a wide range (-0.7572 to 37.1598) to a much narrower range (-1.7162 to 2.2247). Similarly, 'loaded policy count' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' now have ranges of [0.0, 0.0], indicating a potential issue with data collection or processing.

}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning behind the classification and the suggested solution:

* **Failure Classification:** The significant shifts in data ranges across multiple KPIs strongly suggest a failure. These changes are not typical fluctuations and indicate a disruption in the expected data patterns.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  These KPIs were chosen because they show the most drastic changes, indicating potential core system issues.  
* **Reasoning:** The narrowed ranges and zero values in some KPIs suggest problems with data collection, processing, or storage. The shifts in 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' might point to issues with specific functionalities or dependencies.
* **Solution:** The recommended solution focuses on identifying the source of the problem:

    * **Code Review:** Analyze the recent code changes to pinpoint any modifications that might have directly or indirectly affected the KPIs.
    * **Log and Monitoring Analysis:** Examine logs and monitoring data around the time of the change to identify any error messages, performance bottlenecks, or unusual events that might correlate with the anomalies.
    * **Reverting Changes:** If the code review and log analysis point to a specific change as the primary culprit, consider reverting it as a quick fix to restore normalcy. 



Remember, this is a starting point for investigation. A thorough analysis is needed to pinpoint the exact cause and implement a lasting solution.
