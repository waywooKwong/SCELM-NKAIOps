**Explanation of the Response:**

* **`change_type: "failure"`:**  The data indicates a negative impact, so we classify it as a failure. 
* **`reason:`:**  The provided KPI data clearly shows anomalies:
    * **Range Shifts:** Many KPIs have compressed ranges after the change, indicating a potential narrowing of the data distribution.
    * **Trend Changes:**  Several KPIs have reversed their trends (from up to down or vice versa), suggesting the change has altered the underlying behavior.
* **`solution:`:**  This section offers a structured approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the code changes made around the time of the data shift.
    * **KPI Deep Dive:** Analyze the affected KPIs individually to understand the specific nature of the deviations.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Check system logs and metrics around the time of the change to identify potential error messages, performance bottlenecks, or unusual activity.
    * **Rollback:** If the impact is severe, consider reverting the changes as a temporary measure while further investigation is conducted.

	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges after the change. This suggests the change introduced unintended consequences impacting system performance and stability.  Specific examples include [list 3-5 of the most concerning KPIs with their changes].",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made around the time of the change to identify potential causes for the observed anomalies. 2. **Monitor logs and system events:** Analyze logs and system events for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity that might correlate with the changes. 3. **Roll back the change:** If possible, temporarily revert the change to assess if the anomalies disappear. This can help isolate the problematic code or configuration. 4. **Conduct further testing:** Implement additional testing scenarios to identify specific areas where the change negatively impacts system behavior. 5. **Seek expert assistance:** Consult with experienced developers or system administrators to gain further insights and guidance in resolving the issues."
}
```
