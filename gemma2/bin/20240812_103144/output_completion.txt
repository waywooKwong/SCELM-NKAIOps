``` 


**Explanation:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`**  - The provided data clearly indicates that the changes introduced issues. KPIs are showing unusual shifts in range and trend.

* **`reason`**: The analysis points to a high number of KPIs experiencing unexpected changes after the implementation. This strongly suggests the change itself is the cause of the problem.

* **`solution`**: The solution focuses on a systematic approach to debugging:

    1. **Identify the Changes:** Start by understanding exactly what was changed.
    2. **Log and Metric Analysis:** Look for patterns in logs and metrics that coincide with the change.
    3. **Rollback (if possible):**  Temporarily reverting the change can quickly confirm if it's the root cause.
    4. **Targeted Testing:** Design tests to specifically check the areas affected by the change.
    5. **Continuous Monitoring:** Keep a close eye on system performance after any fixes are implemented.

	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues. For example, the 'loaded policy count' KPI shifted from a range of [-0.0287, 34.4205] to [0.0, 0.0], suggesting a possible policy loading failure or a data collection issue.  Furthermore, the 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total))' KPI's trend changed from down to up, which might indicate unexpected network behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count' KPI**: Check if policies are being loaded correctly and if there are any errors in the data collection process. 2. **Monitor the 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total))' KPI closely**: Analyze the network traffic patterns and identify any potential anomalies or spikes. 3. **Review the code changes**: Carefully examine the code modifications made to identify potential causes for the data range shifts. 4. **Conduct thorough testing**: Perform comprehensive tests to ensure the changes have not introduced unintended consequences."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The significant data range shifts across multiple KPIs strongly suggest a failure or unintended consequence of the change.
* **reason:** The provided data clearly indicates anomalies. The 'loaded policy count' KPI dropping to [0.0, 0.0] is a major red flag, implying a potential failure in policy loading. The trend reversal in the 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total))' KPI points to unexpected network behavior that needs investigation.
* **solution:** The proposed solutions focus on:
    * **Troubleshooting the policy loading issue:** This involves checking the policy loading process for errors and ensuring data collection is working correctly.
    * **Monitoring network traffic:**  Closely observing the 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total))' KPI can help pinpoint the cause of the trend change.
    * **Code review:**  Analyzing the changes made to identify the root cause of the data range shifts.
    * **Thorough testing:**  Ensuring the changes haven't introduced unintended side effects.

}
``` 


Let me explain the reasoning behind the "failure" classification and the proposed solution:

* **Multiple KPIs Affected:** The data shows a significant number of KPIs (9 out of 40) exhibiting anomalies after the change. This widespread impact suggests a systemic issue rather than isolated problems.
* **Range and Trend Changes:**  The data ranges for many KPIs have shifted, indicating a change in the magnitude of the values. Additionally, the trends (downward in most cases) have also been affected, suggesting a disruption in the expected behavior.
* **Potential Negative Impact:** The combination of range and trend changes points to a potential negative impact of the change on system performance, stability, or resource utilization. 

The proposed solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

1. **Identify the root cause:** Pinpointing the exact changes responsible for the anomalies is crucial.
2. **Isolate and mitigate:**  Once identified, these changes can be isolated and potentially reverted or corrected.
3. **Monitor and verify:** Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that the issue is resolved and the system operates as expected.

	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "A significant number of KPIs (40 out of 50) show anomalies in their data ranges and trends after the change. This indicates that the change likely had a negative impact on the system's performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 40 anomalous KPIs:**  Analyze the specific changes in each KPI's data range and trend. Identify the most critical KPIs that are most impacted. \n2. **Review the change logs:** Carefully examine the details of the recent changes made to the system. Look for any code modifications, configuration updates, or infrastructure changes that might have coincided with the observed anomalies.\n3. **Compare pre- and post-change data:** Conduct a thorough comparison of the system's performance metrics before and after the change. This can help pinpoint the exact impact of the change on different aspects of the system.\n4. **Roll back the change (if possible):** If the impact of the change is severe and cannot be quickly mitigated, consider rolling back the changes to restore the system to its previous state.\n5. **Implement corrective measures:** Based on the analysis findings, develop and implement corrective measures to address the identified issues. This may involve code fixes, configuration adjustments, or infrastructure improvements."
