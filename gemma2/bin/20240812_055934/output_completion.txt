	"solution": "1. **Investigate the `irate(node_network_transmit_bytes_total)` anomaly:**  Determine the root cause of the steady increase. Is there a spike in network activity or a misconfiguration? 2. **Review logs and system metrics:** Analyze logs and other system metrics around the time of the change to pinpoint potential issues. 3. **Revert the change and test again:** If the situation is critical, consider reverting the change and testing again to rule out its impact. 4. **Implement gradual changes:** Instead of making sweeping changes, consider implementing them in stages to monitor their effects and mitigate potential risks."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a mixed response to the change. While some KPIs show improvements, others exhibit negative trends or anomalies. The "steady increase" anomaly in `irate(node_network_transmit_bytes_total)` is particularly concerning as it suggests potential resource strain or network issues. 

The SCWARN algorithm's identification of anomalies further supports the conclusion that the change introduced instability.  

Therefore, the change is classified as a **failure**. 

The suggested solutions aim to:

* **Identify the root cause of the network anomaly.**
* **Analyze system logs and metrics for clues about the problem.**
* **Consider reverting the change if the situation is critical.**
* **Implement changes gradually to minimize risk.**

* **Network Connectivity:** The decrease in the mean value and range of `irate(node_netstat_Tcp_PassiveOpens{hostname=~"bj1-rd-yos-prod-01"}[2m])` suggests potential problems with network connectivity or service performance.
* **System Instability:** The shift in trend from down to up in `sum(rate(std_grpc_server_handled_total{job=\"be/yid\", grpc_code=\"Unknown\",grpc_method=~"GetEmployee|ListEmployee|GetDepartment|ListDepartment|GetTeam|ListTeam|ListSupervisor|IsDeptLeader|GetDepartTree|GetEmployeeDepartTree|ListUserNameByEmpID|ListAuthZTeamsByUserName|ListWeChatDeptIDByDeptID|ListJiesuanBusinessDeptMember|ListAllInternalEmployees|IsEmployeeBelongToDept|ListApproveAuthEmp|ListApproveAuthDept|ListApproveBackupEmp"}[5m]))` points to potential instability in the system.

**Suggested Solution:**

1. **Log Analysis:** Examine the logs related to the changed system components to identify any error messages, warnings, or unusual events.
2. **Metric Monitoring:**  Closely monitor the KPIs mentioned above, as well as other relevant metrics, to track the system's performance and identify any further anomalies.
3. **Resource Utilization:** Analyze the resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) of the affected systems to rule out resource contention as a cause.
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the anomalies. This may involve reviewing code changes, configuration files, and system architecture.
5. **Corrective Actions:** Implement the necessary corrective actions to address the identified issues. This may include reverting the change, fixing bugs, optimizing code, or adjusting system configurations.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit anomalies of the 'Single spike' type, recovering to normal shortly after. This suggests a transient issue rather than a successful change. The consistent timestamps across different KPIs (e.g., 2024-03-15 12:08:56) point to a potential external event or system-wide disruption.",
	"solution": "Investigate logs and system events around the timestamps of the anomalies (e.g., 2024-03-15 12:08:56) to identify the root cause of the spikes. Consider monitoring for similar patterns in the future and implementing safeguards to mitigate potential impacts."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure:** The recurring "Single spike" anomalies across various KPIs indicate a transient issue rather than a successful change.  
* **Reasoning:**
    * **Consistent Timestamps:** The anomalies occurring at the same timestamps across different KPIs suggest a common trigger.
    * **Transient Nature:** The "Single spike" type indicates a brief surge followed by a return to normal, pointing to a temporary disruption.
* **Solution:**
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine system and application logs around the anomaly timestamps to pinpoint the cause (e.g., a network hiccup, resource contention, or external event).
    * **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for similar patterns in the future.
    * **Mitigation:**  Develop strategies to mitigate the impact of such transient events, such as load balancing, caching, or fault tolerance mechanisms.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit anomalies after the change, including level shifts down, fluctuations, and sudden increases/decreases. This suggests the change negatively impacted system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Roll back the recent change:** This is the most immediate step to restore the system to a known working state. 2. **Investigate the logs:** Analyze logs from the affected systems to identify the root cause of the anomalies. 3. **Monitor KPIs closely:** Continue monitoring the KPIs after the rollback or any subsequent changes to ensure stability is restored. 4. **Test the change in a staging environment:** Before deploying any changes to production, thoroughly test them in a staging environment to identify potential issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a **failure** after the change. Here's why:

* **Multiple KPIs Affected:**  A significant number of KPIs (54) show anomalies, suggesting a widespread impact rather than isolated issues.
* **Types of Anomalies:** The anomalies include:
    * **Level Shift Down:** This indicates a sustained decrease in performance, which is concerning.
    * **Fluctuations:**  Unstable behavior, likely caused by the change disrupting normal system operation.
    * **Sudden Increases/Decreases:** These abrupt shifts point to potential instability or unexpected behavior introduced by the change.

* **SCWARN Algorithm:** The use of SCWARN, a system designed to detect anomalies, further strengthens the conclusion that the change caused problems.


**Suggested Solution:**

The suggested solution focuses on mitigating the immediate damage and identifying the root cause:

1. **Rollback:**  The first priority is to revert the recent change to restore the system to a stable state.
2. **Log Analysis:**  Thoroughly examine logs from affected systems to pinpoint the specific events or code changes that triggered the anomalies.
3. **Continuous Monitoring:**  Keep a close eye on KPIs after the rollback or any subsequent changes to ensure stability is maintained.
4. **Staging Environment Testing:** Before deploying any changes to production, rigorously test them in a staging environment to prevent similar issues from occurring again.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant number of anomalies (529 total) and a high number of anomalous KPIs (59).  While some anomalies recovered to normal, others indicate persistent issues.  KPIs like 'node_sockstat_TCP_inuse' and 'node_sockstat_TCP_tw' show shifts in their trends and ranges after the change, suggesting the change negatively impacted system stability. ",
	"solution": "1. **Review the change logs:**  Carefully examine the specific changes made to identify potential root causes for the anomalies. 2. **Monitor affected KPIs:**  Continuously monitor the KPIs mentioned in the report, particularly those showing persistent issues. 3. **Rollback or modify the change:** If the change is identified as the primary cause, consider rolling back to the previous state or implementing modifications to mitigate the negative effects. 4. **Investigate further:** If the root cause remains unclear, conduct a deeper investigation into system logs, resource utilization, and network traffic to pinpoint the source of the anomalies."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure:** The large number of anomalies and persistent issues in key KPIs like `node_sockstat_TCP_inuse` and `node_sockstat_TCP_tw` strongly suggest the change introduced problems.

* **Reason:** The data clearly indicates a shift in system behavior after the change.  KPIs that were previously trending upwards or downwards now show erratic behavior or reversed trends. This points to a disruption in normal system operations.

* **Solution:** The proposed solutions focus on:
    * **Identifying the root cause:**  Understanding exactly what went wrong is crucial for fixing the issue.
    * **Monitoring:** Keeping a close eye on affected KPIs allows for early detection of further problems.
    * **Remediation:**  Rolling back the change or making modifications is the most direct way to address the issue.
    * **Deep investigation:** If the cause is unclear, further analysis is needed to pinpoint the problem.
