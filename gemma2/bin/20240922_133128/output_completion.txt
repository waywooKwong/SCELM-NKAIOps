**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the data indicates a negative impact after the change.
* **Top abnormal kpis:**  The list highlights KPIs with the most significant shifts.
* **reason:**  The analysis points to potential issues with the implemented changes, particularly affecting 'build' processes, department management, and backup operations.
* **solution:**  Recommends a systematic investigation of the code changes and their impact on the affected KPIs.
