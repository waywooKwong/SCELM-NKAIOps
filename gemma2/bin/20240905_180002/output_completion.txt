**Explanation of the Response:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the provided data clearly indicates issues in the system after the change.
* **reason:**  The response highlights the key indicators of failure:
    * **Significant data range shifts:** KPIs like "GIN" and "build <:*:>" show substantial changes in their minimum and maximum values, suggesting unexpected behavior.
    * **Trend changes:**  Some KPIs, like "sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total))",  shift from a downward trend to an upward trend, indicating a change in system behavior.
* **solution:** The response offers a structured approach to resolving the issue:
    * **Code review:**  The first step is to carefully examine the recent code changes to identify potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log analysis:**  System logs can provide valuable insights into what happened after the change.
    * **Continued monitoring:** Keep a close eye on the affected KPIs to observe any patterns or further changes.
    * **Rollback (if possible):**  If the situation is critical, rolling back the change can restore normalcy while further investigation takes place.
    * **Collaboration:** Involving developers and stakeholders is crucial for a faster and more effective solution.
