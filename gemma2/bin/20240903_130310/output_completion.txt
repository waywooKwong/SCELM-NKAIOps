	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their data ranges after the change, indicating potential issues. For example, 'GIN' shows a drastically reduced range, 'build <:*:> ' and 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:> ' have shifted their minimum values to more negative ranges, and 'message' has a significantly wider range. These changes suggest the change may have introduced unexpected behavior or errors.",
