{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "A significant number of KPIs (98 out of 105) exhibited anomalies in their data ranges and trends after the change. This suggests the change likely introduced negative impacts on system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the recent changes:** Carefully examine the code, configuration, or infrastructure modifications implemented around the time of the change. 2. **Analyze anomaly patterns:** Investigate the specific anomalies in each KPI. Look for commonalities in affected metrics, time periods, or error messages. 3. **Rollback or revert changes:** If possible, temporarily revert the changes to isolate their impact. Monitor the system for improvements in KPI behavior. 4. **Implement targeted fixes:** Based on the analysis, develop and implement targeted solutions to address the root causes of the anomalies. 5. **Monitor and iterate:** Continuously monitor the system after implementing fixes. Track KPI performance and make further adjustments as needed."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in KPI values after the change.  Many KPIs show changes in both range and trend, suggesting a negative impact from the change. ",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the specific cause of these changes. This could involve:\n\n* **Reviewing change logs:** Identify the exact changes made and their potential impact on the system.\n* **Monitoring system resources:** Analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage to detect any bottlenecks or resource contention.\n* **Examining application logs:** Look for error messages or unusual activity related to the affected KPIs.\n* **Comparing pre- and post-change data in more detail:** Use statistical analysis to quantify the magnitude of the changes and identify patterns.\n\nOnce the root cause is identified, appropriate solutions can be implemented to mitigate the negative impact."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The analysis of KPI data reveals a significant number of anomalies (126 out of a total of 128) across various metrics after the change. This indicates potential issues introduced by the change that require investigation and remediation.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the affected KPIs:**  Deep dive into the specific KPIs that show anomalies to understand the nature and extent of the deviations. 2. **Review change logs:** Carefully examine the changes made to identify potential root causes. 3. **Compare configurations:** Compare configurations before and after the change to detect any discrepancies. 4. **Monitor system health:** Continuously monitor system metrics and logs to identify any further issues or patterns. 5. **Rollback the change (if possible):** If the impact is severe, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous state while investigating the root cause."

	"solution": "1. **Review the recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the change to identify potential issues that could be causing the anomalies. \n2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze system logs for any error messages or warnings that may provide clues about the root cause of the anomalies. \n3. **Compare metrics before and after the change:** Conduct a detailed analysis of the metrics before and after the change to pinpoint the specific areas where performance has degraded. \n4. **Rollback the change:** If possible, revert the recent changes to see if the anomalies disappear. This can help confirm whether the change is the source of the problem. \n5. **Implement targeted fixes:** Based on the analysis, develop and implement targeted solutions to address the identified issues."
