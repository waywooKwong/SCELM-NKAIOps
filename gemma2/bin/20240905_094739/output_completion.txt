	"reason": "The system exhibited several anomalies after the change, including unexpected shifts in KPI values and increased error rates.  Specific KPIs like 'ClientEnvHandler is <:*:>' showed a significant drop in performance, indicating potential issues with the environment handling logic.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'ClientEnvHandler is <:*:>' KPI:** Analyze the logs and metrics related to this KPI to pinpoint the cause of the performance degradation. 2. **Review recent code changes:** Compare the code changes made before and after the anomaly to identify potential bugs or configuration issues. 3. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU, memory, and network utilization to rule out resource constraints as a contributing factor. 4. **Rollback the change:** If possible, revert the recent changes to restore the system to its previous state. 5. **Test and debug:** Thoroughly test the system after implementing any fixes to ensure the issue is resolved."
