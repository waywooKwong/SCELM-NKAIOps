``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the data indicates a negative impact after the change.
* **reason:**  The provided data shows a substantial shift in the ranges and trends of many KPIs. This points to a potential problem introduced by the recent change. 
* **solution:** The suggested steps outline a common approach to troubleshooting such issues:

    * **Code Review:** The most direct approach is to examine the recent code changes to see if any introduced bugs or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:** System logs can provide valuable clues about what happened around the time of the change. Look for errors, warnings, or unusual events.
    * **Resource Monitoring:**  Performance issues can sometimes be caused by resource constraints. Check CPU, memory, and network usage to see if any bottlenecks exist.
    * **Testing:**  Rigorous testing is crucial. Unit tests can isolate specific code modules, while integration tests ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly.

This suggests potential issues within the system that require investigation.  Specific anomalies include:  \n\n*  Shifts in data ranges for many KPIs (e.g., container_network_receive_bytes_total, build, parseDataReportFlag ok). \n*  Changes in trends (e.g., from down to up for approve status error). \n*  Extreme values in some metrics (e.g., loadRegoMySQLInterval success).",
	"solution": "1. **Thorough Investigation:** Analyze the specific anomalies in detail. Examine logs, system events, and configuration changes around the time of the anomalies. \n2. **Identify Root Cause:** Determine the underlying cause of the anomalies. This could involve faulty code, resource contention, network issues, or external dependencies. \n3. **Implement Fixes:** Address the identified root causes. This might involve code patches, resource adjustments, network configuration changes, or resolving dependencies. \n4. **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Set up robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect future anomalies promptly. This allows for faster response times and mitigation of potential impacts."
