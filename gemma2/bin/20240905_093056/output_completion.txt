``` 


Let me break down why this classification was made and the reasoning behind the solution:

* **"change_type": "failure"** - The provided data clearly indicates anomalies in multiple KPIs after the change. This suggests the change is likely the cause of the problems.

* **"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their historical trends after the change. This suggests the change may have introduced issues impacting system performance or functionality."** -  This statement directly points to the core issue: the change has disrupted normal KPI behavior.

* **"solution": "Investigate the specific changes made and their impact on the affected KPIs. Analyze the logs and monitoring data for any errors or anomalies related to the time of the change. Consider rolling back the change or implementing corrective measures based on the identified issues."** - This solution provides a structured approach to resolving the issue:
    * **Identify the change:** Understand precisely what was altered.
    * **Impact analysis:** Determine how the change affects the KPIs and the system as a whole.
    * **Error investigation:** Look for logs and monitoring data that reveal problems coinciding with the change.
    * **Corrective action:** Choose between rolling back the change or implementing fixes based on the investigation's findings.
