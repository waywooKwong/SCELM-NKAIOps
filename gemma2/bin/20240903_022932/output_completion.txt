{
	"change_type": "failed",
	"reason": "While some KPIs show improvements (like node_load5), many others exhibit negative changes or mixed trends.  The SCWARN algorithm flags anomalies, indicating instability.  The increase in anomalies (1408 total) and the presence of 'Steady increase' and 'Level shift up' patterns suggest the change may have introduced unforeseen issues.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the anomalies:** Focus on the specific KPIs flagged by SCWARN, particularly those with 'Steady increase' and 'Level shift up' patterns.  2. **Review change logs:**  Carefully examine the changes made to identify potential root causes. 3. **Monitor closely:** Continue to track KPIs and system behavior after implementing any solutions. 4. **Rollback if necessary:** If the situation worsens, consider rolling back the change."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data presents a mixed picture. While some KPIs show improvements, the overall trend points towards instability. Here's why I classify the change as "failed":

* **Increased Anomalies:** A significant jump in the number of anomalies (1408) suggests that the change introduced unexpected behavior.
* **Negative Trends:** Several KPIs show negative changes or mixed trends after the change, indicating potential problems.
* **Specific Anomaly Patterns:** The presence of 'Steady increase' and 'Level shift up' patterns suggests a worsening of conditions over time, rather than a temporary fluctuation.

**Suggested Solution:**

The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to address the issue:

1. **Investigate Anomalies:**  Pinpoint the specific KPIs flagged by SCWARN and analyze their behavior to understand the nature of the problems.
2. **Review Change Logs:** Carefully examine the changes made to identify any potential factors that might have contributed to the anomalies.
3. **Monitor Closely:** Continuous monitoring of KPIs and system behavior is crucial to assess the effectiveness of any solutions implemented.
4. **Rollback if Necessary:** If the situation deteriorates, rolling back the change might be the best course of action to restore stability.

{
	"change_type": "failed",
	"reason": "Many KPIs show a downward trend after the change, indicating potential negative impacts.  Specific examples include irate(node_disk_reads_completed_total), irate(node_netstat_Tcp_PassiveOpens), sum(rate(std_grpc_server_handled_total)), and [GetWeChatUserInfo] GetWeChatUserInf<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>.  The SCWARN algorithm also identifies anomalies, further suggesting issues. ",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent change:** This is the most immediate step to mitigate potential harm. \n2. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the changes made to pinpoint the root cause of the negative impact. \n3. **Monitor key metrics closely:** Continue to track the performance of affected KPIs after the rollback or code fix. \n4. **Implement more robust testing:** Ensure that future changes undergo thorough testing to prevent similar issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a decline in performance after the change. Many KPIs show a downward trend, and the SCWARN algorithm flags anomalies, suggesting a problem.

While the exact nature of the change is unknown, the evidence points to a failed change. The suggested solution involves a rollback to restore the previous state, followed by a thorough investigation to identify the cause and implement preventive measures for future changes.

	"change_type": "failed change",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit anomalies like 'Single spike', 'Level shift up', and 'Level shift down', indicating instability and potential issues. These spikes and shifts suggest unexpected behavior, which could be a result of faulty code, resource contention, or external factors impacting the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the affected services:** Focus on the services related to the anomalous KPIs (e.g., 'be/bkverify' service). Analyze logs, monitor resource usage, and check for recent configuration changes. \n2. **Review code changes:** If there were recent code deployments, thoroughly review them for potential bugs or unintended side effects that could be causing the anomalies.\n3. **Resource monitoring:** Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk) are allocated to the affected systems. Investigate potential bottlenecks or resource contention.\n4. **External factors:** Consider external factors like network issues, database performance, or third-party dependencies that might be contributing to the anomalies.\n5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up more comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and respond to similar anomalies in the future."

	"change_type": "failed",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in KPI values after the change.
