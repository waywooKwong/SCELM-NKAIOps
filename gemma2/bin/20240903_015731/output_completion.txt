	"reason": "The steady increase in multiple KPIs like  <:REQ:>, DeleteFieldValues, and AuthListByName suggests a potential issue with the system's resource consumption or performance.  The consistent upward trend across different KPIs indicates a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Resource Usage:** Analyze system logs and monitoring data to identify which resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) are being heavily utilized. \n2. **Optimize Code:** Review the code for potential performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies. \n3. **Scale Infrastructure:** If resource constraints are identified, consider scaling up the system's infrastructure (e.g., adding more servers or increasing memory). \n4. **Monitor and Alert:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and respond to performance issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data shows a clear pattern of "steady increase" anomalies across several KPIs. This indicates a continuous upward trend in metrics, which is generally not desirable. 

Here's why this points to a failed change:

* **Systemic Issue:** The fact that multiple KPIs are affected suggests a broader problem within the system rather than isolated incidents.
* **Resource Consumption:**  A steady increase in KPIs often points to increased resource consumption. The system might be struggling to handle the workload.
* **Performance Degradation:**  As resources are consumed, system performance can degrade, leading to slower response times and potential errors.

**Suggested Solution:**

The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issue and implementing measures to address it:

1. **Resource Usage Analysis:**  Understanding which resources are being heavily used is crucial. This can help pinpoint the source of the problem.
2. **Code Optimization:**  Inefficient code can lead to unnecessary resource consumption. Reviewing and optimizing the code can improve performance.
3. **Infrastructure Scaling:** If resource constraints are identified, scaling up the infrastructure (adding more servers, memory, etc.) can provide the system with the capacity it needs.
4. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implementing robust monitoring and alerting systems can help detect performance issues early on, allowing for proactive intervention.
