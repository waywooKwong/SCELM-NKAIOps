	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in the distribution of several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  This suggests the change may have introduced unexpected side effects or bugs. The anomalies include a narrowing of data ranges for some KPIs and a change in overall trend for others.  This requires further investigation to pinpoint the root cause.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications introduced with the change. Look for potential logic errors, unintended consequences, or incorrect parameter settings that could be affecting the KPIs. 2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze system logs for any errors, warnings, or unusual activity that occurred around the time of the change. This can provide valuable clues about the source of the problem. 3. **Compare pre- and post-change data:** Conduct a detailed comparison of the KPI data before and after the change. Identify specific KPIs that have shown the most significant deviations and investigate their underlying causes. 4. **Rollback the change:** If the impact of the change is severe, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous state. This can help isolate the problem and allow for a more focused investigation. 5. **Test and debug:** Once potential causes have been identified, implement targeted tests and debugging procedures to confirm the root cause and develop a solution."
