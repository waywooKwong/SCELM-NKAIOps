	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in the distribution of several key performance indicators (KPIs) after a change was implemented.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "failure" because the data clearly shows a negative impact on the KPIs after the change.
* **reason:** The data demonstrates a clear deviation from the expected behavior of the KPIs after the change. This points to a potential problem with the implemented change.
* **solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Identify the changes:** Understand precisely what was altered.
    * **Analyze the impact:** Examine how the changes affected the system and the KPIs.
    * **Root cause analysis:**  Dig deeper to pinpoint the exact source of the anomalies.
    * **Remediation:** Choose the best course of action: revert the change, implement fixes, or find workarounds.
    * **Testing and validation:** Ensure the solution resolves the issues and doesn't introduce new problems.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The provided data shows significant changes in the ranges and trends of multiple KPIs after the change. This indicates a potential issue introduced by the change.  For example, KPIs like 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{...}))' and 'build' have increased maximum values and shifted mean values after the change. This suggests the change might be leading to increased resource consumption or processing load.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code changes implemented after the data collection point. Identify any modifications that could directly or indirectly affect the performance of the system. \n2. **Monitor resource usage:**  Continuously monitor resource usage metrics (CPU, memory, network) after the change to pinpoint any bottlenecks or spikes. \n3. **Test and debug:** Conduct thorough testing to reproduce the observed anomalies. Debug the code to identify the root cause of the performance degradation. \n4. **Rollback or modify the change:** If the issue is confirmed to be caused by the recent change, consider rolling back the changes or modifying them to mitigate the negative impact."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **`change_type: "failure"`:**  The data clearly indicates that the change has resulted in negative consequences, as evidenced by the altered KPI ranges and trends.
* **`reason:`** The provided analysis explains the observed changes in the KPIs and suggests that the change might be responsible for increased resource consumption or processing load.
* **`solution:`** The suggested solutions are aimed at identifying the root cause of the problem and mitigating the negative impact:
    * Review the code changes to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * Monitor resource usage to identify any bottlenecks.
    * Test and debug to reproduce and resolve the anomalies.
    * Consider rolling back or modifying the change if it's confirmed to be the cause.
