Overall, the changes do not appear to be significant anomalies.",
	"solution": "No immediate solution is required as the observed changes do not indicate a failure. Further monitoring and analysis are recommended to understand the long-term impact of the changes."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "normal" because the data doesn't clearly point to a failure. The changes are within expected ranges and some even show improvements.
* **reason:**  Explains that the changes are not dramatic anomalies. Some KPIs improved, some slightly declined, but overall the system seems to be functioning.
* **solution:**  Since it's not a failure, no immediate action is needed. Continued monitoring is advised to observe long-term effects.

* **`change_type`: "failure"`**  This indicates that based on the provided data, the change is likely detrimental.
* **`reason`:** This section explains the rationale behind classifying the change as a failure. It highlights:
    * **Significant Data Distribution Shifts:** The data ranges for several KPIs have changed, suggesting the change might have altered the system's behavior.
    * **Trend Changes:**  Some KPIs show a change in trend (up or down) after the change, indicating a potential negative impact.
* **`solution`:** This section offers actionable steps to address the identified failure:
    * **Investigate Changes:**  Carefully examine the specific changes made to pinpoint their potential causes.
    * **Analyze Logs and Metrics:** Look for error messages, performance degradation, or other clues in system logs and metrics.
    * **Consider Rollback:** If the impact is severe, rolling back the change might be the quickest solution.
    * **Implement Mitigation:** If a rollback is not feasible, develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of the change.
