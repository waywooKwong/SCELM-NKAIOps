	"reason": "The analysis of KPI data reveals a significant number of anomalies (128 out of a total of 24742) after the change. This indicates that the change likely introduced negative impacts on system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the anomalous KPIs:** Focus on understanding the specific changes in the metrics and their potential causes. 2. **Review the change log:** Carefully examine the details of the implemented changes to identify potential culprits. 3. **Roll back the change:** If the anomalies are severe, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous state. 4. **Implement targeted fixes:** Once the root cause is identified, develop and implement solutions to address the issues."

	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "A significant number of KPIs (98 out of 105) exhibited anomalous behavior after the change, indicating a potential negative impact.  The wide range of affected KPIs suggests a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents.",
	"solution": "1. **Roll back the recent change:** This is the most immediate step to mitigate the observed negative impact. 2. **Thoroughly investigate the change logs:**  Identify the specific modifications made and analyze their potential consequences on the monitored systems. 3. **Compare pre- and post-change data in detail:** Focus on the KPIs showing the most significant deviations to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. 4. **Consult relevant documentation and experts:** Seek guidance from system administrators, developers, or monitoring specialists to understand the intricacies of the affected systems and potential solutions. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting systems:**  Establish robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar issues in the future and enable faster response times."
