**Explanation:**

* **`change_type: "failure"`:** This classification is based on the significant and concerning shifts in KPI values after the change. 
* **`reason:`:**  The reason emphasizes the substantial changes in KPI ranges, means, and trends, indicating potential problems stemming from the implemented changes. The high number of anomalies further supports this classification.
* **`solution:`:** The suggested solutions focus on a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Code Review:**  Identify potential bugs or unintended consequences in the recent code modifications.
    2. **Baseline Comparison:** Establish a historical context for the KPIs to better understand the magnitude of the changes.
    3. **Anomaly Investigation:**  Focus on the most problematic KPIs to pinpoint their specific causes.
    4. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**  Continuously track KPIs after implementing solutions to ensure the system stabilizes.

	"reason": "The analysis shows a significant deviation in the data ranges of multiple KPIs after the change. This indicates a potential issue with the implementation or configuration that has caused unexpected behavior.  The wide range of anomalies across various KPIs suggests a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made around the time of the data shift. Look for any changes that could directly or indirectly affect the KPIs in question. 2. **Monitor system logs:** Check the logs for any errors, warnings, or unusual activity that might correlate with the data anomalies. 3. **Compare configurations:** Compare the configurations before and after the change to identify any discrepancies that could be causing the issues. 4. **Rollback the changes:** If possible, temporarily revert the changes to the previous state to see if the data anomalies resolve. This can help isolate the source of the problem. 5. **Gather more data:** Collect additional data points over a longer period to understand the trend and severity of the anomalies. 6. **Consult documentation and support:** Refer to the relevant documentation and seek assistance from support channels if needed."
