{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed changes in KPIs before and after the change. Some KPIs show improvements (e.g., 90.kpi name), while others show declines (e.g., 91.kpi name).  This indicates that the change might have had both positive and negative impacts on different aspects of the system.",
	"solution": "Further analysis is required to understand the specific reasons behind the observed changes. This could involve examining logs, tracing requests, and comparing the behavior of the system before and after the change.  Once the root causes are identified, targeted solutions can be developed to address the negative impacts and enhance the positive effects."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" - The data doesn't clearly indicate a failure.  The mixed results suggest the change had a complex effect.
* **reason:**  The analysis highlights the mixed performance of KPIs. This suggests the change wasn't universally positive or negative, but had a nuanced impact.
* **solution:**  The response emphasizes the need for more in-depth investigation.  It suggests looking at logs, tracing requests, and comparing system behavior before and after the change to pinpoint the reasons for the mixed results.

	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The data ranges show some fluctuation but overall trends remain consistent. Some KPIs show improvement, while others show slight degradation. This suggests the change had a minimal impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "Continue monitoring the KPIs closely. If any significant deviations from normal behavior are observed, investigate further."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The analysis of 51 anomalous KPIs across 1100 total anomalies indicates a significant deviation in performance metrics after the change. This suggests the change introduced negative impacts on system stability and efficiency.",
	"solution": "A thorough investigation is required to pinpoint the specific root cause of these anomalies. This should involve reviewing the code changes, monitoring logs for error messages, and analyzing system resource utilization before and after the change. Based on the findings, targeted solutions can be implemented to mitigate the negative impacts and restore normal system performance."

```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed changes in KPI values after the implementation. Some KPIs show improvements (e.g., irate(node_disk_write_time_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-geass-prod-05"}[2m])), while others show deteriorations (e.g., irate(node_disk_writes_completed_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-geass-prod-01"}[2m])). Overall, the changes appear to be within acceptable ranges and don't indicate a clear failure. Further analysis and monitoring are needed to determine the long-term impact.",
	"solution": "1. **Monitor KPIs closely:** Continue to track the performance of all KPIs, especially those that showed significant changes. \n2. **Investigate outliers:** Look into any data points that are significantly different from the expected range. \n3. **Gather logs and system information:** Collect relevant logs and system information to identify potential issues or bottlenecks. \n4. **Review change implementation:** Carefully review the implementation details to ensure that there were no unintended consequences."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "normal" because the data doesn't conclusively point to a failure. The changes are mixed, indicating potential adjustments rather than a catastrophic problem.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights the mixed nature of the changes. While some KPIs improved, others worsened. This suggests the change might have had both positive and negative effects, requiring further investigation.
* **solution:** The solution focuses on continued monitoring and analysis to understand the long-term impact of the change. It also suggests investigating outliers and reviewing the implementation details to identify potential issues.
