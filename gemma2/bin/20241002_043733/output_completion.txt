**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the provided data indicates a significant shift in KPI values after a change, suggesting potential issues.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** This list prioritizes KPIs with the most drastic changes, excluding those named "build <:*:>" as requested.
* **reason:** The explanation highlights the key observation:  KPIs are exhibiting unusual behavior after the change, implying problems with data or system performance.
* **solution:** The suggested steps provide a structured approach to troubleshooting the issue:
    * **Code review:**  Start by examining the code changes for potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log analysis:**  System logs can often reveal clues about the root cause of problems.
    * **Pipeline verification:** Ensure data pipelines are functioning correctly.
    * **Resource monitoring:** Check if resource constraints are impacting system performance.
    * **Rollback:** If feasible, revert the changes to isolate the problematic modification.
