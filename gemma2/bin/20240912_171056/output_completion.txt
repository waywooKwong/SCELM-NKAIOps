	"reason": "The change resulted in 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' which indicates a significant deviation from expected behavior. This directly points to a failure in the change implementation.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent change:** Immediately revert the software changes to the previous stable version. \n2. **Investigate the root cause:** Thoroughly analyze the defective code and identify the specific errors causing the wrong IP address configuration. \n3. **Re-implement the change:**  After identifying the root cause, correct the code and re-implement the change following the established change management process. \n4. **Regression Testing:** Perform comprehensive regression testing to ensure the corrected change does not introduce new issues."
