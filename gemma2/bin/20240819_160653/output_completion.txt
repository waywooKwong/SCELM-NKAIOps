	"reason": "The provided data indicates a mixed impact of the change. Some KPIs show positive trends (e.g., 79.kpi name: node_filesystem_free_bytes), while others show negative trends (e.g., 75.kpi name: irate(node_disk_read_time_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj3-rd-bkverify-prod-02"}[2m])).

	"solution": "Continued monitoring of these KPIs over a longer period is recommended to assess the long-term impact of the change.  Further analysis of the specific changes implemented could help pinpoint the reasons for the mixed results."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" - We cannot definitively say the change was a success or failure based on the limited data. 
* **Reason:** The data shows both positive and negative changes in different KPIs. This suggests the change might have had both beneficial and unintended consequences. More data and analysis are needed to understand the overall impact.
* **Solution:**
    * **Continued Monitoring:**  Keep tracking these KPIs over a longer period to see if trends stabilize or change.
    * **In-Depth Analysis:** Investigate the specific changes made to identify which aspects might be contributing to the positive and negative results. This could involve reviewing logs, code changes, and system configurations.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed changes in KPI values after the change. Some KPIs show improvement (e.g., node_filesystem_free_bytes, irate(node_disk_reads_completed_total)), while others show deterioration (e.g., sum(rate(std_grpc_server_handled_total))).  Overall, the changes don't indicate a clear failure. ",
	"solution": "Further analysis is needed to understand the impact of the change on each KPI individually. Investigate the reasons behind the positive and negative changes and determine if the overall impact aligns with the desired outcome."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the data doesn't definitively point to a failure. There are both positive and negative changes.
* **reason:**  The KPIs show a mixed bag of results. Some improved, some worsened, and some stayed relatively the same. This suggests the change might have had both positive and negative consequences, making it difficult to call it a clear failure.
* **solution:**  A deeper dive is necessary. We need to:
    * **Analyze individual KPIs:** Understand *why* some improved and others worsened. 
    * **Compare to baseline:** How do the post-change values compare to expected or historical performance?
    * **Consider context:** What was the goal of the change? Did it achieve its intended purpose partially or not at all?

	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed trends for different KPIs. Some KPIs show improvement (e.g., 1-avg(irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-bkverify-prod-01", mode=~"idle"}[2m])), increase(http_service_level_sli_result_count_total{job=\"be/bkverify\"}[2m])), while others show degradation (e.g., pyroscope upload profile: do http <:RequestPost:>).  Without a clear understanding of the specific change implemented and its intended effects, it's difficult to definitively label the change as successful or unsuccessful. ",
	"solution": "To determine the overall impact of the change, a more detailed analysis is required. This should include:\n\n* **Understanding the specific changes implemented:** What code was modified, what configurations were altered?\n* **Defining clear success criteria:** What metrics are most important for evaluating the success of the change?\n* **Comparing pre- and post-change data:** Analyze the trends in relevant KPIs before and after the change to identify any significant differences.\n* **Considering potential confounding factors:** Were there any other changes or events that could have influenced the observed data?"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **"change_type": "normal"**:  The data presents a mixed bag of results, making it impossible to definitively call the change a success or failure. 
* **"reason"**: The provided data doesn't clearly indicate whether the change was successful or not. Some KPIs show positive changes, while others show negative changes. This ambiguity prevents us from making a clear judgment.
* **"solution"**: To properly assess the change, we need more context. The solution outlines the steps needed to gain a clearer understanding of the situation:

    1. **Identify the specific changes made.**
    2. **Define what constitutes success for this change.**
    3. **Compare pre- and post-change data meticulously.**
    4. **Consider any external factors that might have influenced the results.**

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided KPI data reveals several anomalies after the change.  A significant number of KPIs exhibit shifts in their data ranges, trends, and means.  For example, 'xfs' shows a decrease in mean and a shift in trend from up to down. Similarly, 'probe_duration_seconds' and 'irate(node_disk_reads_completed_total)' also display changes in their mean and trend after the change. These inconsistencies suggest that the change has negatively impacted the system's performance.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of these anomalies. This could involve examining system logs, monitoring resource utilization, and comparing configurations before and after the change. Once the root cause is identified, appropriate corrective actions can be taken to restore normal system behavior. This might include reverting the change, adjusting configurations, or implementing performance optimizations."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **`change_type: "failure"`:**  The data clearly indicates negative changes in KPIs after the modification. 
* **`reason:`:**  The provided KPI data shows a pattern of negative changes after the change. Several KPIs experience shifts in their ranges, means, and trends, suggesting a negative impact.  
* **`solution:`:**  A systematic approach is needed to address this:
    1. **Identify the Root Cause:** Analyze system logs, resource usage, and configuration differences to pinpoint what caused the anomalies.
    2. **Targeted Remediation:** Once the cause is found, take steps to fix it. This could involve:
        * **Reverting the Change:** If the change is recent, reverting it might be the quickest solution.
        * **Configuration Adjustments:** Fine-tune system settings to address performance bottlenecks.
        * **Performance Optimizations:** Implement strategies to improve system efficiency.

Some KPIs show improvement (e.g., irate(node_disk_write_time_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-geass-prod-05"}[2m])), while others show degradation (e.g., sum(increase(geass_server_pay_verify_order_total{}[1m]))). Overall, there isn't a clear and consistent trend indicating a failure.",
	"solution": "Further analysis is needed to understand the specific impact of the change on each KPI. It's recommended to monitor the KPIs over a longer period and compare them to historical data to determine if the observed changes are significant and persistent."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "normal" because the data doesn't definitively point to a failure. There are both positive and negative changes.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights the mixed nature of the changes. Some KPIs improved, some worsened, and there isn't a clear overall negative trend.
* **solution:**  The recommended next steps involve:
    * **Continued Monitoring:** Track the KPIs over a longer timeframe to see if the observed changes stabilize or worsen.
    * **Historical Comparison:** Compare the post-change data to historical trends for each KPI to determine if the changes are statistically significant.
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** If specific KPIs show concerning degradation, investigate the potential causes related to the implemented change.
