{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The data ranges for most KPIs show a narrowing after the change, indicating potential improvements in stability and performance. Some KPIs show a shift in trend, which could be due to the change's impact or natural fluctuations. ",
	"solution": "Continue monitoring the KPIs closely for a longer period to observe long-term trends. Investigate any significant deviations or unexpected changes in specific KPIs to identify potential issues or areas for optimization."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the provided data doesn't clearly indicate a failure. 
* **reason:** The analysis focuses on the changes in data ranges and trends. 
    * Narrowing ranges suggest improved stability.
    * Trend shifts could be positive or require further investigation.
* **solution:** Emphasizes ongoing monitoring and deeper analysis of any concerning changes.

{
	"item": "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes"
}
```
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed trends in KPIs before and after the change. Some KPIs show improvement (e.g., 1-avg(irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-bkverify-prod-01", mode=~"idle"}[2m])) by (mode, hostname)), while others show degradation (e.g., pyroscope upload profile: do http <:RequestPost:>). This indicates the change might have had both positive and negative impacts on different aspects of the system. Further investigation is needed to determine the overall impact and root causes.",
	"solution": "1. **Analyze individual KPI trends:** Dive deeper into each KPI's behavior before and after the change to understand the specific impacts. 2. **Correlation analysis:** Investigate potential correlations between KPIs to identify if changes in one area are influencing others. 3. **Log analysis:** Examine system logs for any errors or anomalies that occurred around the time of the change. 4. **Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring of relevant KPIs to track performance over time and detect any emerging issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "normal" because the data doesn't clearly indicate a failure. The mixed trends suggest a complex impact rather than a simple positive or negative outcome.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights the mixed nature of the changes observed in the KPIs. While some show improvement, others show degradation, indicating a complex interplay of factors.  
* **solution:**  The suggested solutions focus on a systematic approach to understanding the change's impact:
    * **Individual KPI analysis:**  Don't just look at the overall trends; understand how each KPI is affected.
    * **Correlation analysis:**  See if changes in one KPI are linked to changes in others. This can reveal underlying relationships.
    * **Log analysis:**  Logs often provide clues about errors or events that coincided with the change.
    * **Continuous monitoring:**  Keep a close eye on KPIs after the change to detect any long-term effects or new problems.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The analysis of 51 anomalous KPIs across 1100 total anomalies indicates a potential system failure. The KPIs exhibit diverse anomalies, suggesting widespread issues rather than isolated incidents. ",
	"solution": "1. **Immediate investigation:**  Focus on the 51 anomalous KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the issues. 2. **Log analysis:** Examine system logs for error messages, warnings, and unusual activity correlated with the anomalous KPIs. 3. **Resource monitoring:** Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for bottlenecks or excessive usage. 4. **Network analysis:** Check network traffic patterns and connectivity for any disruptions or anomalies. 5. **Rollback or remediation:** Depending on the severity and root cause, consider rolling back recent changes or implementing targeted remediation strategies."
