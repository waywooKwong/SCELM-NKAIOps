}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failed change. Here's a breakdown:

* **Data Range Changes:**  Significant reductions in the data ranges for several KPIs (like 'Response=<:MAP:>' and '<:REQ:>') suggest a negative impact. This could mean the change has limited the scope of data or introduced issues that restrict normal behavior.
* **Anomaly Types:** The presence of anomalies like 'Steady decrease', 'Multiple spikes', and 'Level shift down' points to a decline in performance or unexpected behavior after the change. These anomalies are not typical signs of a successful change.

**Suggested Solution:**

The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to address the failed change:

1. **Rollback:** The immediate action is to revert the recent changes to restore the system to its previous stable state.
2. **Investigation:** A thorough examination of the change logs is crucial to pinpoint the specific code or configuration modifications that caused the issues.
3. **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of KPIs is essential to track the system's performance after the rollback or any subsequent changes.
4. **Testing:** Rigorous testing procedures should be implemented to identify and address potential problems before deploying any further changes.
5. **Gradual Implementation:**  To minimize the risk of widespread impact, consider a phased rollout of changes in the future. This allows for more controlled testing and monitoring at each stage.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs across different categories (requests, disk I/O, load, filesystem usage) exhibit 'Single spike' anomalies. This indicates potential resource contention, application issues, or configuration problems. The recurring nature of these spikes suggests a persistent issue rather than isolated incidents.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource usage:** Analyze CPU, memory, and disk I/O metrics during the spike times to identify resource bottlenecks. \n2. **Review application logs:** Look for error messages or unusual activity logs during the spike periods. \n3. **Check configuration settings:** Verify that system configurations (e.g., disk quotas, firewall rules) are not contributing to the spikes. \n4. **Monitor for patterns:** Analyze the timestamps and frequency of the spikes to identify any recurring patterns or triggers. \n5. **Implement load testing:** Conduct load tests to simulate peak traffic and identify system weaknesses."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data reveals a concerning pattern of recurring 'Single spike' anomalies across various KPIs. This indicates a system struggling to handle normal load fluctuations. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Diverse KPIs Affected:**  The anomalies span different system aspects (requests, disk I/O, load, filesystem usage). This suggests a systemic issue rather than a localized problem.
* **Recurring Nature:** The spikes occur repeatedly, indicating a persistent problem. 
* **'Single spike' Anomaly Type:** This type suggests a sudden, brief surge in metric values, likely caused by a sudden increase in demand or a temporary resource bottleneck.

**Conclusion:**

The data strongly points to a **failed change**. The recurring spikes are a red flag, indicating the system is not functioning as expected.

}
``` 


Let me elaborate on the reasoning behind the "failed change" conclusion:

* **KPI Trend Changes:** The provided data clearly shows a shift in the trends of many KPIs after the change.  Several KPIs that were previously trending upwards now show downwards trends, indicating a potential decline in system performance. 
* **SCWARN Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm identifying anomalies further strengthens the case for a failed change. Anomalies suggest unexpected and potentially harmful deviations from normal behavior.
* **Magnitude of Changes:** The changes in min, max, and mean values for some KPIs are substantial, suggesting a significant impact rather than minor fluctuations.

The suggested solution focuses on reversing the changes, investigating the root cause, and implementing a rigorous testing process to prevent similar issues in the future.
