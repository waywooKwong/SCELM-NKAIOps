{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "Most KPIs show a downward trend after the change, which is expected as the change aimed to optimize system performance. Some KPIs, like irate(node_network_receive_bytes_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-bkverify-prod-03",device!~"tap.*|veth.*|br.*|docker.*|virbr*|lo*"}[5m])*8, show an upward trend, which might indicate a positive impact on network reception.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the data trends generally align with the expected outcome of performance optimization.
* **reason:** The analysis points out that most KPIs exhibit a downward trend after the change, suggesting potential improvement in resource utilization or system responsiveness. However, it also acknowledges the upward trend in `irate(node_network_receive_bytes_total)`, which could signify a beneficial impact on network reception.
* **solution:** No specific solution is provided because the overall change appears to be successful based on the data.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed trends in KPIs before and after the change. Some KPIs improved (e.g., 90.kpi name), while others showed a decline (e.g., 91.kpi name). Overall, the data doesn't clearly indicate a positive or negative impact of the change.",
	"solution": "Further analysis is required to understand the specific impact of the change on each KPI. This could involve examining logs, tracing requests, and comparing resource utilization before and after the change."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the data doesn't conclusively show a positive or negative impact. Some KPIs improved, others worsened, making a definitive judgment difficult.
* **reason:** The data presents mixed results. While some KPIs like 90.kpi name show improvement, others like 91.kpi name show a decline. This lack of consistent trend prevents a clear determination of the change's overall effect.
* **solution:**  To get a clearer picture, more in-depth analysis is needed:
    * **Log Analysis:** Examining logs can reveal specific issues or bottlenecks introduced or resolved by the change.
    * **Request Tracing:** Tracking requests through the system can highlight performance bottlenecks or areas where the change had a direct impact.
    * **Resource Utilization:** Comparing resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) before and after the change can identify if the change led to increased resource consumption or efficiency.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "Most KPIs show an upward trend or stable performance after the change. Some KPIs show a decrease, but this could be due to various factors and not necessarily a direct result of the change.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data shows a mixed bag of results after the change. While some KPIs show an improvement (upward trend or smaller range), others show a decrease.  

Here's why classifying this as "normal" is appropriate:

* **No Clear Pattern of Negative Impact:** There isn't a consistent, widespread negative impact across all KPIs. 
* **Possible External Factors:** Changes in system load, user behavior, or other unrelated events could influence some KPIs independently of the change being analyzed.
* **Further Investigation Needed:** To confidently determine if the change caused any negative effects, more in-depth analysis would be required, potentially including:
    * **Time Series Analysis:**  Examining trends before and after the change more closely to isolate the impact.
    * **Correlation Analysis:**  Looking for relationships between the change and specific KPIs.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Reviewing system logs for any errors or unusual activity around the time of the change.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in several KPIs after the change.  For example,  'probe_duration_seconds{hostname=~"bj3-rd-yos-prod-02"}' exhibits a decrease in mean value and a change in overall trend from up to down. Similarly, 'irate(node_disk_reads_completed_total{hostname=~"bj3-rd-yos-prod-03"}[2m])' shows a reversal of trend from down to up. These inconsistencies suggest the change may have introduced unintended consequences.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the change logs:** Carefully examine the code changes implemented to identify potential issues affecting the monitored KPIs. 2. **Compare configurations:** Verify if any configuration changes related to the affected systems or services occurred alongside the primary change. 3. **Monitor resource utilization:**  Track CPU, memory, and disk usage to detect resource contention or bottlenecks that might be caused by the change. 4. **Implement rollback:** If the impact is severe, consider rolling back the change to the previous state while investigating the root cause. 5. **Conduct further testing:** Perform thorough testing with representative workloads to assess the impact of the change on system performance and stability."

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed changes in KPI values after the change. Some KPIs show improvements (e.g., irate(node_disk_write_time_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-geass-prod-05"}[2m])), while others show deteriorations (e.g., sum(increase(geass_server_pay_verify_order_total{}[1m]))). Overall, there's no clear pattern indicating a significant negative impact.",
	"solution": "Further analysis and monitoring are recommended to understand the specific effects of the change on different KPIs. Consider focusing on KPIs that show negative trends and investigate potential root causes."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" - The data doesn't consistently indicate a negative impact. 
* **reason:** The analysis highlights that the changes in KPI values are mixed. Some KPIs show positive changes, while others show negative changes. This lack of a clear negative trend suggests the change might not be causing a significant failure.
* **solution:**  The recommended solution emphasizes continued monitoring and investigation. Focus on KPIs showing negative trends to pinpoint potential issues and determine if further action is needed.
