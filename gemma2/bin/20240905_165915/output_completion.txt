Many KPIs show drastic shifts in minimum and maximum values, as well as alterations in overall trends (up/down). This suggests the change likely introduced unintended consequences or bugs.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the change logs:** Carefully examine the specific changes made to identify potential code modifications, configuration updates, or system deployments that could have caused these anomalies. \n2. **Compare pre- and post-change metrics:** Conduct a detailed analysis of the KPI data before and after the change. Look for specific KPIs that exhibit the most significant deviations and investigate their underlying causes. \n3. **Monitor system logs:** Check for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity in system logs that might provide clues about the root cause of the issues. \n4. **Rollback the change:** If possible, temporarily revert the changes to their previous state to isolate the impact and confirm if the anomalies are indeed caused by the recent modification. \n5. **Test and debug:** Once potential causes are identified, thoroughly test and debug the affected code or configurations to resolve the issues and prevent future occurrences."
