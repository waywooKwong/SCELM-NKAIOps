	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed trends for different KPIs after the change. Some KPIs show a positive trend, while others show a negative trend. This indicates that the change may have had both positive and negative impacts on the system.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The data provided shows a mix of positive and negative changes in various KPIs after the implementation of a change.  

* **Some KPIs show improvement:** For example, `node_sockstat_TCP_tw` shows a slightly higher mean value after the change.
* **Others show deterioration:** KPIs like `irate(node_disk_written_bytes_total{hostname=~"bj3-rd-bkverify-prod-02"}[2m])` show a more negative mean value after the change.

This mixed picture indicates that the change likely had both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of the system.  It's **not possible to definitively classify the change as "success" or "failure"** based on this data alone.

**Next Steps:**

To gain a clearer understanding of the change's impact, you should:

1. **Analyze individual KPIs in detail:** Investigate the trends for each KPI and try to understand the reasons behind the observed changes.
2. **Examine logs and system configurations:** Look for any events or changes in configurations that might correlate with the observed KPI changes.
3. **Consider user behavior:** If the change affected user-facing aspects of the system, analyze user feedback and activity logs to see how users are responding to the change.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows mixed trends for different KPIs after the change. Some KPIs show improvements (e.g., 90.kpi name), while others show deteriorations (e.g., 92.kpi name).  Overall, there isn't a clear pattern indicating a successful or failed change based solely on these metrics.",
	"solution": "Further analysis is required to determine the impact of the change. This could involve:\n\n* **Correlating changes with specific events:** Identify any deployments, configuration changes, or other events that coincided with the data shifts.\n* **Analyzing error logs and system metrics:** Look for any anomalies or errors that might be related to the change.\n* **Gathering user feedback:**  If applicable, collect feedback from users to understand if they perceive any differences in system performance or functionality."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the data doesn't definitively point to a successful or failed change.
* **reason:** The KPIs show mixed results, making it difficult to conclude whether the change was positive or negative. More investigation is needed.
* **solution:**  The suggested steps provide a framework for deeper analysis to understand the impact of the change.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "Most KPIs show an upward or stable trend after the change. Some KPIs show a downward trend, but this could be due to various factors and not necessarily a negative impact.",
	"solution": "Monitor the KPIs closely over a longer period to observe any persistent negative trends. Further analysis of the specific data points and system logs may be required to understand any anomalies."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data shows a mixed trend after the change. While some KPIs show an upward or stable trend, others show a downward trend. 

* **Positive Indicators:** Many KPIs show positive changes or remain stable, suggesting the change might be beneficial. 
* **Negative Indicators:** Some KPIs show a downward trend, which needs further investigation.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Context:**  Without knowing the nature of the change, it's difficult to definitively say whether the observed trends are positive or negative. 
* **Timeframe:** The data only shows a short-term effect. Longer-term monitoring is crucial to assess the true impact of the change.
* **Correlation:**  A downward trend in one KPI might be unrelated to the change and could be influenced by other factors.

**Recommendation:**

Continue monitoring the KPIs closely, paying attention to any persistent negative trends.  Conduct further analysis, including:

* **System Logs:** Examine logs for any errors or unusual activity coinciding with the change.
* **Data Correlation:**  Look for correlations between the KPIs and other system metrics to identify potential contributing factors.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** If negative trends persist, perform a root cause analysis to pinpoint the source of the issue.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in the performance metrics after the change. Multiple KPIs exhibit a downward trend in mean values and altered ranges, indicating potential negative impacts on system performance. For example,  'probe_duration_seconds' on 'bj3-rd-yos-prod-03' shows a decrease in mean value and a smaller range after the change, suggesting potential latency issues. Similarly, 'irate(node_disk_read_bytes_total)' on 'bj1-rd-yos-prod-01' also shows a decrease in mean value and a narrower range, hinting at potential disk read performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of these performance degradations. This could involve analyzing system logs, monitoring resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O), and reviewing the code changes introduced during the deployment.  Once the root cause is identified, appropriate solutions can be implemented, such as optimizing resource allocation, tuning system parameters, or addressing code inefficiencies."

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a mixed impact of the change across various KPIs. Some KPIs exhibit improvements (e.g., irate(node_disk_write_time_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-geass-prod-05"}[2m])), while others show deteriorations (e.g., sum(increase(geass_server_pay_verify_order_total{}[1m]))). Overall, the changes appear to be within expected ranges and don't indicate a significant system failure.",
	"solution": "Continue monitoring the KPIs closely, particularly those that show negative trends. Investigate potential root causes for the observed changes and implement corrective actions if necessary."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the data doesn't clearly indicate a system failure. There are both positive and negative changes, suggesting a complex impact rather than a catastrophic failure.
* **reason:**  The analysis highlights that the changes have a mixed effect on different KPIs. Some KPIs show improvement, others show decline, and the overall impact doesn't point to a system-wide failure. 
* **solution:** The recommended course of action is continued monitoring of the KPIs, especially those showing negative trends. Investigating the root causes of these negative changes and taking corrective actions if needed is crucial.
