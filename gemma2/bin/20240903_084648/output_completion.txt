	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of these changes. This could involve: \n\
1. Reviewing the code changes made.\n\
2. Analyzing logs for errors or warnings around the time of the change.\n\
3. Comparing system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) before and after the change.\n\
4. Testing affected functionalities to identify specific issues.\n\
Once the root cause is identified, appropriate corrective actions can be taken to restore system stability and performance."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "Significant changes in the data ranges and trends of multiple KPIs across various categories (memory, disk, network, service level) indicate a potential system issue.  The wide fluctuations and shifts in trends suggest instability or a disruption in normal operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate individual anomalous KPIs:**  Deep dive into the specific KPIs with the most drastic changes to identify the root cause. Analyze logs, system metrics, and application performance data for each affected KPI. 2. **Monitor system resources:** Closely track CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network traffic to identify any resource bottlenecks or spikes. 3. **Review recent changes:** Check for any recent software updates, configuration modifications, or infrastructure changes that might have coincided with the observed anomalies. 4. **Consult system logs:** Examine system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual events that could provide clues about the problem. 5. **Escalate if necessary:** If the issue persists or cannot be resolved internally, escalate the problem to the appropriate support team or vendor."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
