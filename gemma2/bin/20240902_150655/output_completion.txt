**Explanation:**

The analysis of the provided data points to a failed change. Here's a breakdown:

* **Multiple KPIs affected:**  A significant number of KPIs (32 out of 40) show anomalies after the change. This indicates a widespread impact across the system.
* **Negative trend shifts:** Many KPIs exhibit trends like "Steady decrease," "Level shift down," and "Single dip," suggesting performance degradation.

}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Mixed Results:** The KPIs don't show a clear, consistent improvement. Some KPIs like kpi 37 show positive changes, but others like kpi 38 worsen significantly. This indicates the change didn't have a uniformly positive effect.
* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm detecting numerous anomalies strongly suggests instability and potential regressions introduced by the change. Anomalies indicate unexpected deviations from normal behavior, which is a red flag.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a number of persistent anomalies across different KPIs. This suggests that the system is not operating as expected.  

* **'Level shift down'**: This suggests a consistent decrease in CPU quota utilization, which could indicate:
    * **Misconfiguration**:  The CPU quota might be set too low for the container's needs.
    * **Resource underutilization**: The application might not be utilizing its allocated resources effectively.
* **'Steady increase'**: This points to a continuous rise in CPU usage, which could signal:
    * **Resource contention**: The container might be competing with other applications for resources.
    * **Performance issues**: The application might have inefficiencies or bugs causing excessive CPU consumption.
* **'Steady decrease'**: While this might seem positive, a consistent decrease could also be problematic:
    * **Application issues**: The application might be failing or not functioning as intended.
    * **Resource starvation**: Other applications might be consuming resources, leaving the container with insufficient CPU.


The suggested solutions aim to address these potential issues by:

1. **Investigating the root cause of the 'Level shift down' anomalies**.
2. **Optimizing the application and resource configurations to manage the 'Steady increase' anomalies**.
3. **Determining the reason behind the 'Steady decrease' anomalies and taking corrective action if necessary**. 


By thoroughly investigating these anomalies, you can identify the source of the problem and implement appropriate solutions to restore the system's stability and performance.
