{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "A significant number of KPIs (128 out of the total monitored) exhibited anomalous behavior after the change. This suggests the change likely introduced issues impacting system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 128 anomalous KPIs**:  Analyze the specific changes in each KPI's behavior before and after the deployment. Identify common patterns or affected systems. \n2. **Review change logs**: Carefully examine the deployment logs and any related configuration changes made around the time of the anomaly. Look for potential conflicts or unintended consequences. \n3. **Rollback or revert**: If possible, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state and assess if the anomalies disappear. \n4. **Monitor and debug**: Implement thorough monitoring and logging to track system behavior after implementing any solutions. Use debugging tools to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies."

Let me know if you need help understanding any of the suggestions or want to explore specific KPIs in more detail.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "A significant number of KPIs (98 out of a total of 105) showed changes in their data ranges and trends after the change. This indicates a potential negative impact of the change on system performance.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the specific causes of these anomalies. This includes analyzing logs, monitoring system resource utilization, and comparing the behavior of affected services before and after the change. Once the root cause is identified, targeted solutions can be implemented to mitigate the negative impact and restore normal system operation."

This may involve analyzing system logs, monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), and comparing the system's behavior before and after the change. Once the root cause is identified, appropriate corrective actions can be taken to mitigate the issue."
