"
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Data Range Shifts:** The significant changes in data ranges for several KPIs (like 'Response=<:MAP:>') strongly suggest the change has impacted data processing or retrieval. A smaller range could indicate data is being filtered, truncated, or otherwise altered in a way that's not expected.
* **Sustained Anomalies:** The SCWARN algorithm detecting numerous anomalies over a prolonged period (2 hours) points to a systemic issue introduced by the change.  It's not just isolated incidents; the change is consistently causing deviations from normal behavior.

Given these factors, it's highly probable the change has failed. The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to identify and resolve the problem:

1. **Code Review:**  Start by looking at the code changes themselves.
2. **Monitoring:**  Continuously observe the affected KPIs to understand the pattern of anomalies.
3. **Rollback:** If the situation is critical, reverting to the previous state can restore stability while you investigate.
4. **Testing and Debugging:**  Isolate the source of the anomalies through rigorous testing and debugging.
5. **Log Analysis:** System logs often contain valuable clues about errors or unexpected behavior.

``` 


Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm flagged numerous anomalies, indicating a deviation from expected behavior after the change.
* **Data Range Narrowing:** The data range shrinking to [0.0, 0.0] suggests a potential issue where the change might have limited the data scope or caused data suppression.
* **KPI Anomalies:**
    *  **Multiple spikes:** Indicate sudden bursts of CPU usage, potentially due to unexpected traffic spikes or resource contention.
    * **Level shift up:**  Show a sustained increase in CPU usage, suggesting a permanent increase in workload or inefficient resource utilization.
    * **Steady increase:**  Point to a gradual but continuous rise in CPU usage, which could indicate a problem with resource scaling or application performance.

These anomalies strongly suggest that the change introduced problems, leading to increased CPU consumption and resource contention.

**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failed change. Here's why:

* **Widespread Negative Impact:** Most KPIs show a decline in performance after the change. This suggests a systemic issue rather than isolated problems.
* **Reduced Range:** The data ranges for many KPIs shrink significantly, indicating a loss of variability and potentially a suppression of normal system behavior.
* **Zero Values:**  KPI `REQ`  goes from a range of -7.0481 to 28.8908 to a range of 0.0 to 0.0. This drastic change suggests a complete halt in the measured activity, which is highly concerning.
* **Trend Shift:** The overall trend for many KPIs shifts from upward to downward, further confirming the negative impact of the change.

**Suggested Solution:**

The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to address the failed change:

1. **Rollback:**  Immediately revert the recent changes to restore the system to its previous, stable state.
2. **Log Analysis:** Carefully examine the change logs to pinpoint the specific modifications made.
3. **Code Review:** Scrutinize the code related to the affected components to identify the root cause of the performance degradation.
4. **Thorough Testing:** After implementing fixes, conduct rigorous testing to ensure the system functions correctly and the anomalies are resolved.

	"change_type": "failed",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in KPI values after the change.  Many KPIs show a reversal in trend (from up to down or vice versa) and a narrowing of their ranges. This suggests the change introduced unintended consequences, likely negatively impacting system performance or stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Roll back the change:** Immediately revert to the previous state to restore known functionality. \n2. **Investigate the change:**  Thoroughly review the code and configuration changes made.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failed Change:** The data clearly shows a negative impact on system performance after the change. KPIs that were trending upwards now trend downwards, and vice versa. This indicates a failure in achieving the intended outcome.

* **Reasoning:**

    * **Trend Reversal:** The shift in trend for multiple KPIs suggests a fundamental change in system behavior. This is unlikely to be a coincidence and points to the change as the cause.
    * **Range Narrowing:** The reduction in the range of KPI values after the change could indicate that the system is becoming less responsive or stable. 
    * **Anomaly Timestamps:** The SCWARN algorithm identifying anomalies at specific timestamps further strengthens the link between the change and the observed issues.

* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on a systematic approach to resolving the issue:

    * **Rollback:**  This is the immediate action to minimize damage and restore functionality.
    * **Investigation:**  A thorough analysis is crucial to understand the precise nature of the change's impact.
    * **Log and Metric Analysis:**  These provide valuable insights into the system's behavior before and after the change.
    * **Testing and Iteration:** A structured testing process allows for targeted fixes and continuous monitoring to ensure the issue is resolved and the system functions correctly.

**Explanation:**

The data clearly points to a failed change. The drastic shifts in KPI values, especially the significant drops in KPIs like  `irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total)` and `rego exec input:<:MAP:>`  along with the numerous anomalies detected by SCWARN, strongly suggest that the change introduced instability and negative performance impacts. 

The suggested solution emphasizes a rollback to the previous stable state, followed by a thorough investigation to pinpoint the root cause of the failure.  Implementing a more rigorous testing strategy, enhanced monitoring, and performance regression testing will help prevent similar issues in the future.
