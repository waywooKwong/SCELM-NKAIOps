	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'sum(increase(std_grpc_server_handled_total{job=\"be/yid\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\", grpc_code=\"OK\"}[1m]))' and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' drops:** Analyze logs and system resources to identify bottlenecks or errors causing the performance decline. Review the code changes related to these metrics and ensure they are functioning as expected. 2. **Address the 'approve status error' and 'svc.ApproveCallback failed' issues:**  Debug the approval processes to pinpoint the root cause of the errors. This may involve checking configuration files, reviewing code logic, and examining error logs. 3. **Resolve the ' <:REQ:>' and 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>' data collection issue:** Verify the data collection mechanisms for these metrics. Ensure the necessary instrumentation is in place and functioning correctly. Review any recent changes that might have impacted data collection."
