	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 128 anomalous KPIs:** Analyze the specific changes in each KPI's range, mean, and trend.  Identify common patterns or affected systems.\n2. **Review recent changes:** Scrutinize the code changes, configuration updates, or deployments that coincided with the anomaly detection.\n3. **Rollback or revert changes:** If possible, temporarily revert the changes to assess if the anomalies disappear. This helps isolate the problematic modification.\n4. **Monitor system logs and metrics:**  Closely monitor system logs, error messages, and performance metrics after the change to identify potential root causes.\n5. **Consult documentation and support:** Refer to relevant documentation, online resources, or seek support from developers or system administrators familiar with the affected systems."
