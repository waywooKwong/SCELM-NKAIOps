{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"reason": "The provided metric, 'Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes', indicates a potential issue.  This suggests that the software changes introduced resource contention, which can lead to performance degradation and instability.",
	"solution": "1. **Analyze resource usage:** Identify the specific resources (CPU, memory, network) experiencing contention. Tools like `top`, `htop`, or resource monitoring dashboards can help. 2. **Review code changes:** Examine the recent code modifications to pinpoint the sections that might be causing excessive resource consumption. 3. **Optimize code:** Refactor the code to reduce resource usage, improve efficiency, and mitigate contention. 4. **Adjust resource allocation:** If necessary, increase resource limits for affected processes or applications. 5. **Monitor resource usage closely:** Continuously track resource consumption after implementing changes to ensure the issue is resolved and prevent future occurrences."
