	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications made to identify potential sources of the anomalies. 2. **Compare pre- and post-change logs:** Analyze system logs for any errors or warnings that occurred around the time of the change. 3. **Roll back the change:** If possible, temporarily revert the changes to see if the anomalies disappear. This can help isolate the problematic code. 4. **Monitor KPIs closely:** Continue to monitor the affected KPIs and other relevant metrics after implementing any solutions to ensure stability."

Look for potential errors, unintended consequences, or misconfigurations. 2. **Compare data before and after:** Conduct a detailed comparison of the KPI data before and after the change. Identify specific KPIs that show the most significant deviations and investigate the underlying causes. 3. **Monitor system logs:** Check system logs for any errors, warnings, or unusual activity that occurred around the time of the change. 4. **Roll back the change:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting critical operations, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. 5. **Test thoroughly:** Once potential issues are identified and addressed, perform thorough testing to ensure the system functions correctly and KPIs return to expected ranges."
