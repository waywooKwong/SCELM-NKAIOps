Look for any alterations that could directly or indirectly impact the affected KPIs. 2. **Monitor resource utilization**:  Observe CPU, memory, and network usage during the period after the change. Identify any spikes or bottlenecks that might correlate with the observed anomalies. 3. **Log analysis**: Examine application logs for errors or warnings that might provide clues about the root cause. 4. **Rollback or revert**: If the impact is severe, consider reverting the changes to the previous state to restore normal operation while further investigation is conducted."
