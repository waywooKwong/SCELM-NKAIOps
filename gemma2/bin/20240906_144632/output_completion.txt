Focus on areas related to the affected KPIs. 2. **Compare logs and metrics before and after the change:** Analyze system logs and metrics from both periods to identify any patterns or events correlated with the anomalies. 3. **Isolate the problematic component:**  Attempt to isolate the specific component or module responsible for the observed changes. This can involve disabling or commenting out sections of code to pinpoint the source of the issue. 4. **Regression testing:** Execute comprehensive regression tests to verify the functionality of the system after the change. Pay particular attention to areas related to the affected KPIs. 5. **Seek expert assistance:** If the issue persists, consult with experienced developers or system administrators for further guidance and troubleshooting."
