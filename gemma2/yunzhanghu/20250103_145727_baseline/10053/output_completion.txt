	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,message,getBackupEmp success,sum(requests),computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics data shows significant deviations from normal patterns. Several KPIs, including AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, getBackupEmp success, sum(requests), and computeOwnObjectIDs end, exhibit unusual spikes or drops in their values. This suggests potential issues with resource contention, service performance degradation, or unexpected user behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the top 5 abnormal KPIs:**  Dive deeper into the data for these KPIs to pinpoint the exact nature of the anomalies. Analyze logs, system metrics, and application code for clues.\n2. **Monitor resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify bottlenecks or overloaded resources that might be contributing to performance issues.\n3. **Review recent code changes:**  If any recent updates or deployments coincided with the onset of anomalies, review them carefully for potential bugs or unintended consequences.\n4. **Implement logging and monitoring:** Enhance your logging and monitoring infrastructure to capture more detailed information about system behavior and facilitate faster issue detection and resolution."
