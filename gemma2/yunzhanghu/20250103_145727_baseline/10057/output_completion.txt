	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected ranges.  AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, and sum(rate(http_requests_total{job=\"jiesuan-app\"}[1m])) by (method) indicate potential performance issues or increased load. computeOwnObjectIDs end shows a sudden drop to zero, suggesting a possible interruption in its operation. message exhibits a narrowing range, potentially indicating a reduced variety of messages being processed.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Consider examining logs and system resources for each affected KPI. For example:\n\n* **AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>**: Monitor authentication requests and potential bottlenecks in user authorization processes.\n* **getBackupEmp success**: Analyze backup operations and check for successful completion rates.\n* **sum(rate(http_requests_total{job=\"jiesuan-app\"}[1m])) by (method)**: Identify the specific HTTP methods experiencing high request rates and investigate potential performance issues in those endpoints.\n* **computeOwnObjectIDs end**: Trace the execution flow of this operation to determine why it's suddenly stopped. \n* **message**: Analyze the types and frequency of messages processed to understand any shifts in patterns."
