	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate a significant deviation from expected behavior. Several KPIs related to resource consumption (container_memory_rss), task success rates (approve status error, request_success_rate), and system performance (get_request_time) show substantial fluctuations or degradation. This suggests potential issues with resource allocation, application functionality, or underlying infrastructure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI:**  Determine why this metric is consistently reporting empty values. This could indicate a data processing issue or a problem with the data source itself.\n2. **Analyze 'container_memory_rss':** Monitor resource usage of containers and investigate potential memory leaks or inefficient code that might be contributing to high memory consumption.\n3. **Troubleshoot 'approve status error':** Examine the application logs for errors related to task approval processes. Identify and address any bottlenecks or issues hindering successful approvals.\n4. **Optimize 'get_request_time':** Profile the codebase to identify performance bottlenecks that are causing slow response times. Consider caching, optimizing database queries, and improving code efficiency.\n5. **Enhance monitoring of 'request_success_rate':**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms for this KPI. Track trends over time and investigate any sudden drops in success rates to pinpoint the root cause."
