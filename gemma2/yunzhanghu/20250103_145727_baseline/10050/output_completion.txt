	"reason": "Several KPIs indicate performance degradation or unusual behavior. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a shift in data distribution, while 'getBackupEmp success' and 'message' experience increased negative values. The repetition of 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' suggests potential bottlenecks or issues with object retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of anomalies in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message'. Analyze system logs, resource utilization, and code related to object retrieval operations for 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to identify bottlenecks or errors. Implement appropriate solutions, such as optimizing database queries, caching frequently accessed data, or addressing performance issues in the object retrieval logic."
