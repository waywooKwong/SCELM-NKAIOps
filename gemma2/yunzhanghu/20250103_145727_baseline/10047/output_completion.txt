	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from their normal ranges, indicating potential system issues. Specifically, KPIs related to user operations (e.g., 'avg (user operation time)'), authentication (e.g., 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'), backup processes ('getBackupEmp success'), and container resource usage (e.g., 'sum (container metrics by (pod,namespace,node))') exhibit alarming trends.",
	"solution": "A thorough investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This may involve analyzing logs, monitoring system resources closely, and examining recent code changes. It's crucial to identify whether the issues stem from faulty configurations, resource constraints, or software bugs."
