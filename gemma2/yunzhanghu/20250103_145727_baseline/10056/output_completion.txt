	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals several KPIs exhibiting significant deviations from expected patterns. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success' shows a positive trend shift, while 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' demonstrate downward trends.  Additionally, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show unusual spikes in values.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root causes of these anomalies. This may involve examining relevant logs, system configurations, and recent changes that could have influenced the KPIs. For instance, a review of backup procedures for 'getBackupEmp success' and adjustments to authentication processes for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' might be necessary. Monitoring resource utilization and identifying potential bottlenecks could shed light on the issues affecting 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'. "
