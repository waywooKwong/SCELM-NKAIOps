	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success,message,summaries,computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in data patterns for several key KPIs, including AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, summaries, and computeOwnObjectIDs end. These changes suggest potential issues with user authentication, data retrieval processes, and system communication.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> anomaly:** Analyze logs and system activity to identify any recent changes or configurations that might have affected user authentication. Review access control policies and permissions to ensure they are properly configured. \n2. **Examine getBackupEmp success and message anomalies:** Investigate potential database connection issues, data corruption, or performance bottlenecks affecting backup operations. Check backup logs for error messages and review system resource utilization. \n3. **Analyze the summaries and computeOwnObjectIDs end anomalies:**  Review system logs and application code to pinpoint any changes or errors related to data aggregation and object retrieval processes. Consider optimizing database queries and indexing strategies. \n4. **Monitor system performance:** Continuously monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to identify any resource constraints impacting system stability.  \n5. **Implement logging and alerting:** Enhance logging mechanisms to capture relevant events and implement alerts for critical metrics to proactively detect and address potential issues."
