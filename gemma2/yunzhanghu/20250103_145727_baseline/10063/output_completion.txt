	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "The top 5 kpis that are primarily responsible: \n1. container_memory_rss\n2. approve status error\n3. superiorAndDeputy empty\n4.  build \n5. trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>",
	"reason": "The provided metrics data indicates several key performance indicators (KPIs) are significantly outside their expected ranges, suggesting a system failure.  Specifically:\n\n* **Memory Usage:** `container_memory_rss` is experiencing higher-than-normal memory consumption.\n* **Approval Process:** The `approve status error` KPI shows an increased rate of errors within the approval process.\n* **Tracing Information (build, trace.id):** The 'build' and tracing information KPIs have inconsistent fluctuations, potentially indicating issues with request processing or application logic.  \n \nThese anomalies combined point to a potential resource contention issue impacting system performance.",
	"solution": "To address these issues, consider the following:\n\n1. **Investigate Memory Consumption:** Analyze `container_memory_rss` patterns and identify memory-intensive processes or applications. Optimize code and configurations to reduce memory footprint.\n2. **Troubleshoot Approval Errors:** Examine the root cause of `approve status error`. Review application logs and system configuration related to the approval process for any errors or bottlenecks.\n3. **Review Tracing Data:** Analyze the trace information (`build`, `trace.id`) for patterns or anomalies that can pinpoint problematic areas in request handling.  \n4. **Monitor System Resources:** Closely monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify potential resource constraints contributing to the issues.\n5. **Scaling and Load Balancing:** If necessary, scale up resources or implement load balancing strategies to distribute workloads more evenly."
