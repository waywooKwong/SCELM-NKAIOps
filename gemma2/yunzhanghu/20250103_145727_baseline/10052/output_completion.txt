{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several key metrics show significant deviations from normal patterns after the change. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' indicate potential issues with authentication and data retrieval processes. Additionally, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'  shows a spike in negative values, suggesting problems with object identification.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Authentication Logs:** Analyze logs related to 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify potential authentication failures or permission issues.\n2. **Review Data Retrieval Processes:** Examine the code and configurations involved in data retrieval processes, particularly for metrics like 'message' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', to pinpoint any bottlenecks or errors.\n3. **Monitor System Resources:** Check CPU, memory, and disk utilization during periods of high activity related to these affected KPIs. Optimize resource allocation if necessary.\n4. **Roll Back Recent Changes:** If possible, temporarily revert the recent changes to isolate their impact and gather more data for analysis."
