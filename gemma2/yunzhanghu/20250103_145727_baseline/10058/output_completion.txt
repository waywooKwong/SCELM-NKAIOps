	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "36. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, 11. getBackupEmp success, 26. message, 8. computeOwnObjectIDs end, 37.  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their normal ranges after the change. Notably, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a decline in its mean value, indicating potential issues with data retrieval or processing.  'getBackupEmp success', 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and others show either reduced performance or unexpected spikes, suggesting underlying system problems.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the logs and error reports associated with affected KPIs like 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the root cause of data discrepancies. 2. Review the code changes implemented recently to identify potential bugs or configuration errors impacting KPI performance. 3. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) closely during periods of abnormal behavior to rule out resource contention issues. 4. Roll back the recent changes if possible and isolate the problematic modification through iterative testing."
