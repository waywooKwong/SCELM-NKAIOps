	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method, code)",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their expected behavior.  'AuthListByName', 'getBackupEmp', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs' show unusual peaks and valleys in their values after the change. Additionally, the 'message' KPI indicates a potential communication issue, as it shows an increase in negative values. These anomalies suggest that the change may have introduced errors or performance bottlenecks in specific system components.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to the affected KPIs ('AuthListByName', 'getBackupEmp', 'computeOwnObjectIDs', and 'message'). Analyze logs and monitoring data to pinpoint the source of the issues. Consider reverting the change or applying targeted fixes to restore normal operation."
