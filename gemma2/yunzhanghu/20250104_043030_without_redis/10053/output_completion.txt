	"solution": "Investigate the changes that were implemented recently to pinpoint the source of these anomalies. Analyze the network traffic data to identify potential bottlenecks or unusual activity. Review the logs related to authentication and user access to understand any issues with the AuthListByName process. Monitor the performance of getBackupEmp and computeOwnObjectIDs end closely, and consider optimizing their code if necessary."

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**:  The provided data indicates a clear shift in metrics after a change was made, pointing to a potential failure or undesirable outcome.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: The list focuses on KPIs that show the most drastic changes and are not named 'build'. This helps isolate potential root causes.
* **reason:**  The analysis explains the observed deviations in network traffic (container_network_receive_bytes_total), authentication (AuthListByName), and performance metrics like getBackupEmp success and computeOwnObjectIDs end.

* **solution**: The suggested steps provide a structured approach to troubleshooting: 
    1. **Identify the change:**  Review recent changes to pinpoint the potential culprit.
    2. **Analyze network traffic:** Look for unusual patterns or bottlenecks in container communication.
    3. **Investigate authentication issues:** Examine logs related to user access and the AuthListByName process.
    4. **Monitor performance metrics:** Keep a close eye on getBackupEmp success and computeOwnObjectIDs end, and consider optimizing their performance if needed.
