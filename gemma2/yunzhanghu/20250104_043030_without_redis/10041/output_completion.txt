	"reason": "The metrics show a significant increase in the negative values for several KPIs, indicating potential performance issues or errors.  Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success', 'message' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' are showing more negative values after the change. Furthermore, the overall trend of these KPIs is now downwards, suggesting a regression.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made recently that could have impacted the performance of these KPIs. Analyze the logs and error messages related to 'getBackupEmp success', 'message' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the root cause of the issues. Consider reverting any recent changes that appear to be causing problems or implementing fixes based on the identified root causes."
