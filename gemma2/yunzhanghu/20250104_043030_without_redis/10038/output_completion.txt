{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their usual patterns. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show unusual spikes or drops in values, indicating potential system instability or configuration issues. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code and configuration related to the affected KPIs**:  Identify any recent changes that might have introduced these anomalies. 2. **Analyze logs and error messages**: Look for specific errors or warnings related to the affected components. 3. **Monitor system resources**: Check CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O for signs of overload or contention. 4. **Review security policies**: Ensure that access controls and permissions are properly configured. 5. **Rollback recent changes**: If possible, revert any recent modifications to the system that could have caused these issues."
