{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success\nauthorizationListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\nmessage\nsummarizeObjectIDs \ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal behavior after the change. These include 'getBackupEmp success', 'authorizationListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', 'summarizeObjectIDs', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'. This suggests a potential issue with authentication, data processing, or communication within the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the recent modifications to identify any potential issues related to authentication, database interactions, or API calls. \n2. **Check logs and error messages:** Investigate system logs for any relevant errors or warnings that occurred around the time of the change.  \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs:** Continuously monitor the performance of these abnormal KPIs to understand the extent and nature of the issue. \n4. **Rollback changes (if possible):** If feasible, revert the recent changes to restore the system to its previous state and identify the root cause of the problem.  \n5. **Test thoroughly:** After implementing any fixes, perform comprehensive testing to ensure that the system functions correctly and the abnormal behavior is resolved."
