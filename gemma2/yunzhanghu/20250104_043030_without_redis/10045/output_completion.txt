	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace=\"jiesuan\", pod=\"*\"})) by (pod)",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from normal behavior. These include metrics related to system resource utilization ('computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message'), user access and authentication ('AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' ), backup operations ('getBackupEmp success'), and overall container CPU usage.  The combination of these anomalies suggests a potential issue with system performance, resource contention, or unexpected application behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource usage:** Analyze the container CPU usage metrics in detail to identify specific pods or containers consuming excessive resources. Consider scaling up affected pods or optimizing applications for better resource utilization.\n2. **Review logs and debugging information:** Examine application logs and system events for any error messages or warnings related to authentication, backup operations, or performance bottlenecks.\n3. **Monitor key system components:** Keep a close eye on metrics related to memory, disk I/O, and network traffic to identify potential resource constraints contributing to the anomalies.\n4. **Test and troubleshoot applications:** Perform thorough testing of the affected applications to pinpoint any code issues or configuration problems causing performance degradation or unexpected behavior.\n5. **Review recent system changes:** If the anomalies occurred after recent deployments or updates, roll back changes or investigate their impact on system stability."
