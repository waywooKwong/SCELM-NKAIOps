	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs related to system performance and resource utilization have shown significant deviations from normal patterns. This suggests potential issues with application logic, database performance, or underlying infrastructure.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'.\n2. Monitor system logs and resource usage for any spikes or errors during the period of abnormal KPI behavior.\n3. Review application code for potential bottlenecks or inefficient queries that could be contributing to performance issues.\n4. Optimize database configurations and query performance to reduce latency and improve resource utilization.\n5. Consider scaling up infrastructure resources if necessary to meet increased demand."
