	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success , AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end, sum(duration) by (job)", 
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided metrics indicates a significant deviation from normal behavior. Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show substantial increases or decreases in their values, suggesting potential issues with system performance, resource utilization, or application logic.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the Top 5 abnormal kpi**: Dive deeper into the specific logs and metrics associated with these KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.  \n2. **Monitor resource usage**: Check CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network traffic for any signs of bottlenecks or spikes that could be contributing to performance degradation.\n3. **Review recent code changes**: If applicable, examine recent code deployments or updates to identify any potential regressions that might be causing the issues.\n4. **Implement logging and monitoring**: Enhance your system's logging and monitoring capabilities to provide more granular insights into application behavior and facilitate quicker issue identification in the future."
