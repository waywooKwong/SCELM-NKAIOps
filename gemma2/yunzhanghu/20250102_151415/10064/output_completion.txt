	"reason": "The metrics indicate potential resource contention, performance degradation, and system instability. The high memory consumption coupled with errors in the approval status and build processes suggests a severe issue.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of high memory consumption using monitoring tools and system logs. \n2. Optimize memory usage by adjusting application configurations, releasing unused resources, and identifying memory leaks. \n3. Analyze build process failures to pinpoint bottlenecks and implement corrective measures. \n4. Review the approval status error logs for patterns and address underlying issues in the workflow.  \n5. Consider scaling up system resources if necessary to accommodate increased workload."
