	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "1. getBackupEmp success\n2. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n3. message\n4.  computeOwnObjectIDs end\n5.  sum(container_cpu_cfs_quota)",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) are showing anomalous behavior, indicating a potential system issue. KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'message' exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges, suggesting underlying problems with authentication, database operations, or communication protocols. The increased CPU CFS quota suggests possible resource contention.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the logs and system metrics related to 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'message' to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.\n2. Analyze the resource usage patterns, particularly CPU utilization, to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.\n3. Consider upgrading or configuring relevant components, such as authentication servers or database systems, to handle increased load or address performance issues.\n4. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect and respond to similar anomalies in the future."
