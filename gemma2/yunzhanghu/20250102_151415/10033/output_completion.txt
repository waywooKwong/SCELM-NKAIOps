{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,computeOwnObjectIDs end,  sum(requests) ",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in data distribution for several KPIs. The 'message' KPI shows a wider range of values with a lower mean after the change. Similarly, KPIs like 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' also exhibit changes in their means and ranges. This suggests potential issues with data processing or service performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code and configurations related to the affected KPIs.  Examine logs and error reports for any clues about the cause of the changes. Consider rolling back the recent changes if they are suspected to be the root cause. Additionally, monitor the system closely for further anomalies."
