Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold.",
	"solution": ""
}
```  

Let me explain why:


* **`change_type`: "normal"`** : The provided data shows that none of the metrics have exceeded defined thresholds. This indicates a normal operational state.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: ""** : Since there are no anomalies, there are no KPIs to list.
* **`reason`: "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold."**:  This is the most straightforward explanation based on the given information. All metrics fall within acceptable ranges.
* **`solution`: ""**:  No solutions are needed because there are no identified issues. 



Let me know if you have any other questions or would like to explore different scenarios!
