	"reason": "The data indicates a significant spike in the 'AuthListByName' metric, suggesting potential authentication issues. Concurrently, several other KPIs related to object retrieval and messaging exhibit anomalies, indicating potential performance bottlenecks or communication failures.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Authentication Errors:** Examine logs and monitoring data for 'AuthListByName' to pinpoint the root cause of authentication spikes. Review user access controls and permissions.\n2. **Optimize Object Retrieval Performance:** Analyze the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and related metrics for performance bottlenecks. Consider caching strategies or database tuning.\n3. **Monitor Message Queue Health:** Investigate potential issues in the message queue, particularly around 'message' metric. Ensure sufficient resources and efficient message processing."
