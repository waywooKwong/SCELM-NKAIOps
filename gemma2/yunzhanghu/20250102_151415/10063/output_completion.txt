	"reason": "Multiple KPIs show significant deviations from normal ranges, indicating potential performance issues or errors in the system. The 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI suggests a problem with data relationships, while 'container_memory_rss' indicates excessive memory consumption.  'approve status error' points to a failure in the approval process.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of these anomalies. For example:\n* **Memory Consumption:** Analyze resource usage patterns for containers and optimize applications to reduce memory footprint.\n* **Approval Process:** Review the approval workflow and identify any bottlenecks or errors causing status failures.\n* **Data Relationships:**  Examine the 'superiorAndDeputy' data to understand why it is empty. Ensure proper data synchronization and integrity."
