{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(requests) ",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate several significant deviations from the expected patterns. Kpis like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and  'sum(requests)' show unusual spikes or drops, suggesting potential issues with data processing, API calls, or system load.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the anomalies in individual KPIs**: Analyze logs, traces, and system performance metrics to pinpoint the root cause of the deviations in each KPI.\n2. **Review recent code changes**: Check for any recent updates that might have introduced bugs or unintended consequences affecting these KPIs.\n3. **Monitor resource utilization**: Pay close attention to CPU, memory, and network usage to identify potential bottlenecks or resource contention issues.\n4. **Scale resources if necessary**: If system load is exceeding capacity, consider scaling up resources like servers or databases.\n5. **Implement monitoring and alerting**: Set up robust monitoring systems with alerts to notify you of any future anomalies in these critical KPIs."
