	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has drastically reduced, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show notable changes in their ranges, hinting at potential problems in object retrieval, department management, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the drastic reduction in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and ensure policies are being loaded correctly. 2. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify the root causes of the shifts in their data ranges. 3. Review logs and monitoring data for any errors or anomalies that occurred around the time of the change. 4. Consider rolling back the change if the identified issues are severe and impacting system functionality."
