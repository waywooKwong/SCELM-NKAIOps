{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getPermTagsAndValues, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, superiorAndDeputy empty, approve status error",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in the ranges for several KPIs after the change.  'getPermTagsAndValues' and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' exhibit extreme changes in their minimum and maximum values, indicating potential issues with data retrieval or processing. 'container_cpu_usage_seconds_total' and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' show altered trends, suggesting resource contention or unexpected behavior in container management. 'approve status error' indicates a potential problem with the approval workflow.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'getPermTagsAndValues' and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' KPIs:** Examine the logs and configuration related to these metrics to identify the root cause of the extreme value changes. 2. **Monitor 'container_cpu_usage_seconds_total' and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' closely:**  Check for resource bottlenecks or configuration issues that might be causing the altered trends. Consider adjusting resource allocation or reviewing relevant configurations. 3. **Analyze the 'approve status error' metric:**  Review the workflow and error logs to pinpoint the specific stage where approvals are failing.  Address any identified issues in the approval process."
