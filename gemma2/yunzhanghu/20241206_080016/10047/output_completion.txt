	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction to zero, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit changes in both minimum and maximum values, suggesting potential performance or functionality problems. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue. Analyze the logs and system metrics for the affected KPIs to identify the source of the performance degradation or functionality problems. Consider rolling back the recent change or implementing temporary mitigations until a permanent solution is found."
