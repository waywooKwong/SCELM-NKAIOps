	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' have drastically reduced ranges, suggesting a possible decrease in activity or a problem with data collection. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' shows a change in trend, while 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' have become zero-valued, indicating potential failures or service disruptions.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the reduced ranges in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'. Analyze the trend change in 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and determine if it's a desired shift or a symptom of a problem.  Address the potential failures in 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' by reviewing logs, checking system health, and ensuring necessary dependencies are functioning."
