	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a narrowing range with a change in mean, suggesting potential data filtering or processing errors.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit shifts in their ranges, implying impacts on data collection or processing related to department information and authentication.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications made to identify the specific changes that might be affecting these KPIs. 2. **Check data pipelines:** Ensure that the data pipelines responsible for collecting and processing these KPIs are functioning correctly. Look for any data loss, corruption, or filtering issues. 3. **Monitor logs and error messages:** Analyze logs and error messages from the systems involved to identify any potential issues or warnings related to these KPIs. 4. **Test and validate:** Implement thorough testing to verify the functionality of the systems after the change and to identify any regressions or unexpected behavior. 5. **Roll back changes (if necessary):** If the issues persist, consider rolling back the changes and reverting to the previous state while further investigating the root cause."
