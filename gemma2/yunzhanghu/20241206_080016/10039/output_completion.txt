	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, build <:*:>, message",
	"reason": "The data analysis shows a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'build <:*:>' show changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting problems with object retrieval and build processes. 'message' also exhibits a change in range and trend, hinting at potential communication or error handling issues. These combined anomalies strongly suggest a failure.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drop. Review logs and system configurations related to policy loading. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'build <:*:>' to identify bottlenecks or errors in object retrieval and build processes. Examine the 'message' KPI for error messages or unusual patterns that could shed light on communication or handling issues. Implement necessary fixes and monitor the KPIs closely after the changes."
