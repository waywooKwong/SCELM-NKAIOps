	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu,  loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to zero, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit increased variability and potentially negative trends. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a drastic decrease in mean value, suggesting problems with MySQL interval loading. 'getBackupEmp success' also shows a downward trend, indicating potential backup failures. These anomalies suggest a systemic issue following the change.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:**  Determine the cause of the policy count dropping to zero. Review policy configurations, loading mechanisms, and any error logs related to policy management. 2. **Analyze 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu':**  Examine the data for spikes or unusual patterns. Investigate potential bottlenecks or resource constraints affecting these processes. 3. **Address 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' issues:**  Check MySQL server logs and performance metrics. Optimize database queries, consider increasing resource allocation, or investigate potential configuration problems. 4. **Review 'getBackupEmp success' failures:**  Analyze backup logs for errors and identify failed backups. Ensure backup configurations are correct and verify data integrity. 5. **Monitor system resources:**  Keep a close eye on CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify any resource contention issues that might be contributing to the anomalies."
