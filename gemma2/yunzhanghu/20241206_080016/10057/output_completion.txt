	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "GIN, loaded policy count, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change.  'GIN', 'loaded policy count', 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' all show either a drastic reduction in range or a shift in trend from down to up, indicating potential issues with data processing or system behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced with the update to pinpoint the source of these anomalies.  Focus on the affected modules and functions related to 'GIN', policy loading, object ID processing, department management, and backup operations.  Review logs and monitor system performance for further clues."
