	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in the performance of several key metrics after the change.  Metrics like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and 'callback status error' show a drastic decrease, suggesting potential issues with request handling and error rates.  'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' and 'get metadata from header' also exhibit notable changes, indicating problems with specific functionalities. 'ClientEnvHandler is <:*:>' shows a downward trend, hinting at potential issues in the client environment handling.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Thoroughly review the code changes introduced to pinpoint the source of the performance degradation. 2. **Monitor logs and error reports:** Analyze logs and error reports for clues about the specific issues affecting the affected metrics. 3. **Test and debug:**  Implement targeted tests to isolate and debug the problematic code sections. 4. **Optimize resource allocation:**  Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory) are allocated to the affected services. 5. **Roll back the change:** If the issues are severe and cannot be quickly resolved, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous stable state."
