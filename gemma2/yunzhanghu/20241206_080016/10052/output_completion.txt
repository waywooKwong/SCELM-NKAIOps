	"reason": "The system exhibits a significant shift in performance metrics after the change. Several KPIs, including loaded policy count, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, and network traffic metrics, show drastic changes in their ranges and means, indicating potential issues with policy loading, object retrieval, and network communication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the root cause of these performance regressions. Analyze logs and system resource utilization to identify bottlenecks or unexpected behavior. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigating measures to restore system stability."
