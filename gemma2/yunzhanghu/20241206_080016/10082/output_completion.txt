	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant decrease in the range and mean values for several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This indicates a potential performance degradation or issue with the system.  KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and 'callback status error' have shown a notable drop in their values, suggesting potential problems with request handling and error rates.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code changes made to identify potential issues that might be causing the performance degradation. 2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze system logs for any error messages or warnings that might provide clues about the root cause of the problem. 3. **Check resource utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to identify any resource bottlenecks that could be impacting performance. 4. **Test and debug:** Conduct thorough testing and debugging to isolate the specific issue causing the performance degradation. 5. **Roll back changes:** If possible, consider rolling back the changes to restore the system to its previous state while further investigation is conducted."
