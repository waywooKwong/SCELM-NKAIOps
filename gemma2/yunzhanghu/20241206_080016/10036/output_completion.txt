	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic decrease in minimum and maximum values, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' all exhibit increased maximum values and shifted means, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' by reviewing logs and monitoring system resources. Analyze the performance bottlenecks identified in the other KPIs by examining resource usage, code execution time, and database queries. Consider optimizing resource allocation, code efficiency, and database performance to mitigate the observed issues."
