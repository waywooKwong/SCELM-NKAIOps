	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, suggesting a policy loading problem. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success' show changes in trends and ranges, implying potential problems with object ID management and backup processes. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a downward trend and reduced range, indicating potential issues with user authentication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the policy loading process for 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and ensure policies are being loaded correctly. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' to identify the root cause of the shifts in trends and ranges. Review the authentication logic for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to address the downward trend and reduced range."
