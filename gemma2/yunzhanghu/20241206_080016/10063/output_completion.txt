	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  Metrics like `receive_bytes_total`, `getPermTagsAndValues`, `parseDataReportFlag ok`, `container_memory_rss`, and `approve status error` show a notable increase in variance and a change in overall trend. This suggests that the change may have introduced unexpected behavior or performance bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "Investigate the specific changes made and their impact on these affected KPIs.  Analyze logs and system metrics to pinpoint the root cause of the performance degradation. Consider rolling back the change or implementing mitigations to address the identified issues."
