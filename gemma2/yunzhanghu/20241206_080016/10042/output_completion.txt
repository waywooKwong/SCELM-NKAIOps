	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show drastically reduced minimum values, suggesting problems with data loading or processing. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit reduced maximum values, pointing to potential failures in retrieving or processing information.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced and their impact on data loading, processing, and retrieval. Analyze logs and error messages for clues about the root cause of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing temporary workarounds to mitigate the impact."
