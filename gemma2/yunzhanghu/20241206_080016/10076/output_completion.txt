	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant negative shifts after the change, indicating potential issues with performance and functionality.  'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' suggest problems with approval processes, while '<:REQ:>' and 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>'  indicate errors related to data requests. 'svc.ApproveCallback failed' further points to problems with callback functionality.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made and focus on the affected KPIs. Review logs and error messages for clues.  Consider reverting the changes or implementing targeted fixes to address the identified issues."
