	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in range and trend after the change, indicating potential issues. 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to a very narrow range, suggesting a possible policy loading failure. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' all show upward trends in the mean, which could indicate increased resource utilization or performance bottlenecks. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a downward trend in the mean, potentially reflecting a change in authentication behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI to identify the cause of the narrowed range. Analyze the increased resource utilization in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation. Further examine the change in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to understand the impact on authentication behavior and ensure security."
