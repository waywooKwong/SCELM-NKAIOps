	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>' , 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'build <:*:>[trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>]' show drastic changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting a potential issue with the implemented change. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:**  Carefully review the code modifications introduced with the change to identify potential areas causing the observed KPI deviations. 2. **Analyze logs and error messages:** Examine logs and error messages generated around the time of the change to pinpoint specific issues or failures. 3. **Revert the change partially or fully:** If possible, revert the change in stages or entirely to isolate the source of the problem. 4. **Monitor KPIs closely:** After implementing any solutions, closely monitor the KPIs to ensure the issue is resolved and performance stabilizes."
