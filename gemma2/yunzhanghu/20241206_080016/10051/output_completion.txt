	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  Metrics like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to 0, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading.  KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show altered trends and ranges, indicating potential disruptions in object retrieval, department management, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate policy loading:**  Examine logs and system configurations related to policy loading to identify the cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drop.  2. **Review object retrieval processes:** Analyze the 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPIs for bottlenecks or errors. 3. **Troubleshoot backup and authentication:**  Dive into the logs and configurations for 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint any authentication or backup-related issues. 4. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to rule out resource constraints impacting these processes. 5. **Revert the change:** If the issue persists, consider reverting the recent change and investigating alternative solutions."
