	"reason": "Significant changes in the data ranges and trends of several KPIs indicate potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a reduced range and a downward trend, suggesting potential problems with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit positive changes in range and trend, but this might be an unexpected deviation. 'getBackupEmp success' also shows a positive change in range and trend, which could be a positive sign but requires further investigation. 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' shows a positive change in range but a downward trend, indicating potential network performance issues.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the cause of the reduced range and downward trend in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'**. This could involve checking policy files, logs, and resource usage. 2. **Monitor 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' closely to ensure the positive changes are sustainable and not indicative of underlying problems.** 3. **Further analyze the positive changes in 'getBackupEmp success' to understand the potential reasons and implications.** 4. **Investigate the network performance issues indicated by the positive range and downward trend in 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8'. This could involve reviewing network logs, analyzing container resource usage, and checking for any network bottlenecks.**"
