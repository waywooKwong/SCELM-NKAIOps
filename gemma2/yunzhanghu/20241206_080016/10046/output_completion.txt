	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in range and trend after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' now consistently at 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show shifts in trend, suggesting potential problems with department member management. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit range and trend changes, pointing to potential authentication or backup issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue to determine why policy loading has stopped. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to identify the root cause of the trend shifts. Review logs and system configurations related to 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the source of the anomalies."
