	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  shows a complete reduction in data range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' all show changes in data range and trend, suggesting potential problems with data retrieval and processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:** Analyze the policy loading process and identify the root cause of the reduced data range. 2. **Review the affected KPIs:** Examine logs and system events related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the source of the changes. 3. **Rollback the change:** If possible, revert the recent change and monitor the KPIs to see if the issues are resolved. 4. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Establish robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies in these KPIs in real-time, enabling quicker response to potential issues."
