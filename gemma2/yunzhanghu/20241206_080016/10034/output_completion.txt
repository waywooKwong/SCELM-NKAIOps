	"reason": "The data ranges for several key KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in data, suggesting a possible policy loading failure. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show changes in mean and range, indicating potential problems with department management, backup processes, authentication, and object identification.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading failure in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and address it. Review the logs and configurations related to 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to identify the source of the changes and implement necessary fixes."
