	"reason": "The change introduced a significant increase in the range of several KPIs, including network receive bytes, build, loaded policy count, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs, and Depts only have yunzhanghu. This suggests potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior introduced by the change. The upward trend in container network receive bytes indicates increased network traffic, which could be caused by increased data access or communication between containers.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes**: Carefully examine the code changes introduced to identify potential causes for the increased network traffic and KPI fluctuations. 2. **Monitor system resources**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify any resource bottlenecks that may be contributing to the performance issues. 3. **Optimize code**: Optimize the code to reduce unnecessary data access and communication between containers. 4. **Implement caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the need for repeated data retrieval. 5. **Load test**: Conduct load testing to identify the system's capacity and performance under different workloads."
