	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly narrowed after the change, indicating a potential decrease in request volume and operational stability.  Specifically, KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a dramatic drop in their maximum values, suggesting a possible issue with service availability or request processing.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes implemented and identify potential bottlenecks or issues affecting request handling. Review logs and monitoring data to pinpoint the specific areas experiencing reduced activity and performance degradation. Consider rolling back the recent changes or implementing temporary mitigations to restore service stability."
