	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data shows a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:> ' has drastically reduced, indicating potential issues with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit concerning changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting broader performance degradation. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:> ' issue:**  Analyze the policy loading process to identify bottlenecks or errors causing the drastic reduction. Review logs and system configurations related to policy management. 2. **Examine the affected KPIs:** Deep dive into the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the root causes. This may involve reviewing code changes, monitoring system resource utilization, and analyzing error logs. 3. **Rollback or revert the change:** If possible, consider rolling back the recent change to restore the previous state while further investigation is conducted. 4. **Implement monitoring and alerting:**  Establish robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies in these KPIs in real-time, enabling proactive issue resolution."
