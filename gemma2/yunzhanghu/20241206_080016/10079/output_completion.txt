	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in data ranges for several KPIs after the change. This indicates a potential issue with the implementation, as the values are now concentrated in a much narrower range.  Specifically, KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' have drastically reduced ranges, suggesting a possible decrease in activity or a failure to handle requests correctly.  The 'callback status error' KPI also shows a narrower range, indicating potential issues with service calls. ",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code implemented to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences that could be causing the observed behavior. 2. **Monitor logs:** Analyze application and system logs for any error messages or unusual patterns that might provide clues about the root cause. 3. **Test thoroughly:** Conduct comprehensive testing to identify and isolate the specific functionality affected by the change. 4. **Roll back the change:** If the issue cannot be quickly resolved, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous state and investigate further. 5. **Seek expert assistance:** If the problem persists, consult with experienced developers or engineers for assistance in diagnosing and resolving the issue."
