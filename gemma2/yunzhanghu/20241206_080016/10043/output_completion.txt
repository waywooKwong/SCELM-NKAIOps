	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  dropped to 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting potential problems with data processing or authorization. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:**  Determine why policy loading has stopped. Check for errors in configuration files, network connectivity problems, or issues with the policy database. 2. **Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**:  Review the code and logs related to these KPIs to identify the root cause of the changes. Look for performance bottlenecks, data inconsistencies, or authorization errors. 3. **Monitor the system closely:** Continue to track the performance of these KPIs after implementing any solutions to ensure that the issues are resolved and that the system is stable."
