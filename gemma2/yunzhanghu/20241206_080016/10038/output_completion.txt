{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in its maximum value and a shift towards negative values. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success' all show  reduced minimum values and increased maximum values, indicating potential issues with data collection or processing. 'message'  shows a reversed trend, going from up to down, suggesting a change in the system's behavior.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the code changes made to identify the specific modifications that might have impacted these KPIs. 2. Analyze logs and system events around the time of the change to pinpoint potential errors or anomalies. 3. Compare the data before and after the change in more detail to understand the nature and extent of the shifts. 4. Consider rolling back the changes if the impact is severe and cannot be quickly mitigated. 5.  Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar issues in the future."
