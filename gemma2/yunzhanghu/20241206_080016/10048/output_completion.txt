	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has drastically reduced to zero, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading or retrieval.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show upward trends, indicating possible resource contention or increased load on these systems.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' reduction.  Review logs and system configurations related to policy loading and retrieval. Monitor resource utilization for 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to identify potential bottlenecks. Consider scaling resources or optimizing system configurations to address the observed trends."
