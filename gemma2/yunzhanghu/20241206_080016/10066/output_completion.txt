	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Depts only have yunzhanghu, getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>' and 'parseDataReportFlag ok' show a notable decrease in their mean values, suggesting potential issues with data processing or system functionality.  'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a complete shift to zero, indicating a possible failure in a critical component. 'superiorAndDeputy empty' also exhibits a downward trend, hinting at potential problems in data retrieval or system interactions. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in these KPIs. Analyze logs, system configurations, and recent code changes to pinpoint the source of the issue.  Consider rolling back the recent changes if they appear to be the primary cause.  Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively identify similar issues in the future."
