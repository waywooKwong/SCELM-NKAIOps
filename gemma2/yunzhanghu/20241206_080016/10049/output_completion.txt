	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in several key performance indicators after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to zero, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' all show a decrease in negative values, which could indicate problems with object retrieval and data access.  'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' shows a decrease in network traffic, which might be related to the other issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue. Review logs and configurations related to policy management. Analyze the changes in object retrieval and data access metrics to identify potential bottlenecks or errors. Monitor network traffic closely and analyze any anomalies. Consider rolling back the recent changes if the issues persist."
