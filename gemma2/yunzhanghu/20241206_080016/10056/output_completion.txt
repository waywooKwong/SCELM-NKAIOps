	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a drastic reduction in range, indicating potential issues with data collection or processing.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit shifts in their mean values and trends, suggesting potential performance or functional problems.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes in data collection and processing pipelines for KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'. Analyze the reasons behind the shifts in mean values and trends for 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'getBackupEmp success'. Review logs and monitoring data to identify potential errors or bottlenecks."
