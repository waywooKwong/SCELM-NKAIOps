	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in its range and mean, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading or application. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' also exhibit altered ranges and trends, pointing to problems within object management and retrieval processes. 'message' shows a wider range and a shift in the mean, indicating potential communication or data processing issues. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue affecting 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' by examining logs and configuration files. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' to identify any bottlenecks or errors in object management. Review the 'message' data to pinpoint any communication failures or data processing anomalies. Implement necessary fixes and monitor the KPIs closely after applying the solutions."
