	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_network_receive_bytes_total, getPermTagsAndValues, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in the metrics after the change. Several KPIs, including container_network_receive_bytes_total, getPermTagsAndValues, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, and superiorAndDeputy, exhibit unusual trends with wider ranges and negative mean values. This suggests potential issues with network communication, data processing, and system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes made:** Carefully review the code and configuration changes implemented to identify potential sources of the anomalies. 2. **Monitor resource utilization:** Track CPU, memory, and network usage to pinpoint bottlenecks or resource contention. 3. **Check logs for errors:** Analyze system and application logs for any error messages or warnings that might shed light on the issues. 4. **Test and debug:** Perform thorough testing to reproduce the anomalies and isolate the root cause. 5. **Roll back changes:** If possible, revert the changes to the previous state to restore normal operation while investigating further."
