	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shown significant negative changes after the implementation. This includes a decrease in 'sum(increase(std_grpc_server_handled_total{job=\"be/yid\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\", grpc_code=\"OK\"}[1m]))', indicating a potential drop in server request handling.  'approve status error', '<:REQ:>' and 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>' also show negative trends, suggesting issues with approval processes and data manipulation. Additionally, 'svc.ApproveCallback failed' shows a rise in failures, further pointing to problems in the approval workflow.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation in the KPIs. Analyze logs and system metrics related to the affected components. Review the changes implemented and identify any potential conflicts or unintended consequences. Consider rolling back the changes if necessary and implement corrective measures to address the identified issues."
