	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>’ has become extremely limited, suggesting a problem with policy loading. KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show substantial shifts in their ranges, implying disruptions in their respective functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>’ issue:** Analyze the policy loading process to identify bottlenecks or errors preventing policies from being loaded correctly. 2. **Review the affected KPIs:** Examine the code and configurations related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the root cause of their range shifts. 3. **Roll back the changes:** If the issue persists, consider reverting the recent modifications and analyzing the differences to isolate the problematic changes."
