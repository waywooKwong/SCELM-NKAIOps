{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has a drastically reduced range and a shift in mean, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' all show upward trends in their means and expanded ranges, suggesting potential performance improvements or changes in data distribution. 'message' shows a positive shift in mean, indicating potential improvements in communication or processing. However, the overall combination of these changes suggests a larger systemic impact that requires further investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Analyze the logs and error messages** associated with 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' to identify the cause of the reduced range and investigate potential policy loading issues. 2. **Monitor the performance of the affected services** related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' to understand the nature of the improvements and identify any potential bottlenecks. 3. **Review the code changes** introduced with the update to pinpoint any potential causes for the observed changes in KPI behavior. 4. **Conduct further testing** to validate the observed improvements and identify any unforeseen consequences of the changes."
