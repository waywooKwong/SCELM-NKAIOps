	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  shows a drastic reduction in data range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  show increased data range and shifted means, suggesting potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the reduced data range in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and ensure policies are being loaded correctly. 2. Analyze the increased data range and shifted means in the other KPIs to identify the root cause of the performance degradation or unexpected behavior. 3. Review logs and system monitoring data for any clues related to the changes. 4. Consider reverting the modification and testing again to isolate the issue."
