	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_network_receive_bytes_total, getPermTagsAndValues, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from the expected behavior. Several KPIs, such as container_network_receive_bytes_total and getPermTagsAndValues, exhibit drastic changes in their ranges, indicating potential network or data processing issues. The 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' KPI showing a range of [0.0,0.0] suggests a potential problem with the MySQL interval loading. Additionally, 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'parseDataReportFlag ok' KPIs demonstrate unusual trends, further supporting the failure classification.",
	"solution": "Investigate the network traffic patterns for the affected containers and pods. Analyze the logs and configurations related to 'getPermTagsAndValues' and 'parseDataReportFlag ok' to pinpoint the source of the anomalies. Check the MySQL connection and interval settings for 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' KPI. Review the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI for any potential data inconsistencies or missing information.  Consider restarting affected services or deploying new configurations to resolve the issues."
