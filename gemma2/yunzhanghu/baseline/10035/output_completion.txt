	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:> '  shows a drastic reduction to 0, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success' all exhibit shifts in their ranges, pointing to potential errors in object handling and authentication. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also shows a significant change, indicating a possible issue with user authorization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to policy loading, object handling, authentication, and user authorization. Analyze logs and error messages for clues about the root cause of the issues. Consider reverting the changes or applying corrective patches to restore the KPIs to their previous stable ranges."
