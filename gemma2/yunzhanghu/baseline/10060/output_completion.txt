	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges after the change. This indicates potential issues with resource utilization, request processing, and system stability.  The 'approve status error' KPI indicates potential problems with workflow approvals, while the 'irate' KPI suggests increased CPU usage.  The 'rego exec input:<:MAP:> ' and '<:GIN:' KPIs might point to issues with policy enforcement or resource allocation. The 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPI suggests potential issues with department configuration or data integrity.",
	"solution": "Investigate the affected services and components to identify the root cause of these anomalies.  Review logs, monitor resource consumption, and analyze system events to pinpoint the source of the problem.  Consider reverting the recent changes or implementing corrective measures to restore normal system behavior."
