	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in the performance of several key metrics after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has dropped to 0, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading. Other metrics like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show negative trends with reduced performance. This suggests a widespread impact on system functionality.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue. Review logs and system configurations related to policy management. Analyze the performance degradation in other metrics to identify potential dependencies and cascading effects. Implement necessary fixes and monitor the system closely after applying changes."
