	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' have drastically reduced their range, indicating potential issues with policy loading and object retrieval. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' shows a narrowing range, suggesting a potential imbalance in department structures. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' also show a reduction in range, implying potential problems with data access and backup operations. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in these KPIs. Review recent code deployments and configuration updates to identify potential issues. Monitor system logs and resource utilization to pinpoint bottlenecks or errors. Consider rolling back the recent change if it appears to be the primary cause of the anomalies."
