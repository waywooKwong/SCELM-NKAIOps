	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'  have shifted to a much narrower range with zero values, indicating a potential issue with data collection or processing. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' shows a wider range after the change, suggesting a possible increase in variance or unexpected behavior. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' also exhibit a reduction in range and a shift in mean, hinting at potential performance bottlenecks or issues with these specific tasks.",
	"solution": "Investigate the data collection and processing pipelines for 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' to determine the cause of the zero values. Analyze the changes in 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to identify the contributing factors and potential solutions.  Review the performance of 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' and optimize any bottlenecks to restore their previous performance levels."
