	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their data ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  drops to a constant 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  all show negative shifts in their mean values and/or reduced ranges, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval, department management, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue ('loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' ). Review logs and configurations related to policy management. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify any code or configuration changes that might have caused these deviations. Consider reverting recent changes or implementing fixes based on the analysis."
