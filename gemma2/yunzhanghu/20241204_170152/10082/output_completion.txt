	"reason": "The data ranges for many KPIs have significantly narrowed after the change, indicating a potential decrease in activity or a shift in behavior.  Several KPIs, like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and 'kpi name: <:list modules:>' show a downward trend in both mean and range, suggesting a reduction in requests or module activity.  The 'callback status error' KPI also shows a downward trend, potentially indicating a fix for a previous issue. However, the overall reduction in data range across many KPIs raises concerns about potential unintended consequences.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made and their impact on the system. Analyze the logs and traces for the affected KPIs to understand the reasons behind the reduced activity.  Review the changes to the 'callback status error' KPI to ensure the fix is effective and not causing any new issues.  Consider reverting the changes if the reduction in activity is deemed detrimental to the system's functionality."
