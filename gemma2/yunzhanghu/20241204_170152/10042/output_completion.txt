	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in the metrics after the change. Multiple KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', show drastically reduced minimum values and expanded maximum values, suggesting potential issues with data processing or service performance.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit unusual trends, indicating potential problems with specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' anomaly:** Analyze the reasons behind the reduced minimum value and expanded maximum range. Review policy loading processes and identify potential bottlenecks or errors. 2. **Examine 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' issues:**  Analyze the code responsible for retrieving object IDs and identify potential performance regressions or errors introduced by the change. 3. **Review 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' functionalities:**  Debug these functionalities to pinpoint the root cause of the unusual trends. Consider logging and monitoring to gain deeper insights into their behavior."
