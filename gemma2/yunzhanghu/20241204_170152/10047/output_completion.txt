	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly changed after the modification. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a drastic reduction in their range, indicating potential issues with policy loading and object retrieval. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit shifts in their ranges, suggesting problems with department management, backup operations, and authentication processes. These changes collectively point towards a failure in the system's functionality.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI:** Analyze the policy loading process and identify any bottlenecks or errors that might be causing the reduction in range. 2. **Review the 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' KPI:** Examine the code responsible for retrieving object IDs and check for potential issues with database queries or object retrieval logic. 3. **Scrutinize the 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPIs:**  Investigate the specific functionalities related to these KPIs and look for any configuration changes or code modifications that might have introduced the observed shifts in their ranges. 4. **Implement logging and monitoring:** Enhance the system's logging and monitoring capabilities to track the performance of these critical KPIs and identify any recurring issues. 5. **Roll back the changes:** As a temporary measure, consider rolling back the recent changes to revert the system to a stable state while further investigation is conducted."
