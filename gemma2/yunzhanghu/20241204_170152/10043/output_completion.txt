	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' all exhibit shifts in their mean and range, suggesting underlying issues with data processing or retrieval.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' anomaly to determine why the range has shrunk. Review policy loading mechanisms and configurations. 2. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' to pinpoint the source of the data discrepancies. 3. Examine logs and system metrics for potential errors or performance bottlenecks related to these KPIs. 4. Consider reverting the recent changes if they are identified as the root cause of the anomalies."
