	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in the performance of several key metrics after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  shows a drastic reduction in range, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  also exhibit changes in their ranges and trends, indicating potential performance bottlenecks or errors.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:** Analyze the logs and configuration related to policy loading to identify the cause of the reduced range. 2. **Monitor the affected KPIs:** Continuously track the performance of 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify any further anomalies or trends. 3. **Review recent code changes:**  Compare the code changes made before the change with the current codebase to pinpoint any potential bugs or regressions that might be contributing to the performance issues. 4. **Consider rolling back the change:** If the issues are severe and the root cause is unclear, consider reverting the recent change to restore the previous stable state."
