	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in the metrics after the change. Multiple KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' which dropped to 0, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' all exhibit either drastically reduced ranges or unexpected changes in mean and trend. This indicates a potential issue with the implementation of the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced and identify the specific modifications that might be causing these anomalies. Analyze logs and system monitoring data to pinpoint the source of the issue. Consider rolling back the change or implementing targeted fixes to restore the expected behavior of these KPIs."
