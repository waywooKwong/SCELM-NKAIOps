	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "There are significant changes in the data ranges and trends of several KPIs after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range and mean, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show reversed trends, suggesting potential problems with object ID retrieval and department management. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit changes in their ranges and trends, pointing to potential issues with authentication and backup processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in the affected KPIs. Analyze logs and system events to identify the specific issue causing the data fluctuations. Review recent code changes and configurations to pinpoint potential culprits. Once the root cause is identified, implement appropriate solutions to address the issues and restore normal KPI behavior."
