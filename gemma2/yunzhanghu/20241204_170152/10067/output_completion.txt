	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Depts only have yunzhanghu, getPermTagsAndValues, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in the metrics of several KPIs after the change. KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues', 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' exhibit drastic changes in their ranges and trends, indicating potential issues introduced by the change. The reduction in the range and the shift in trend for 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' to [0.0,0.0] is particularly concerning, suggesting a complete halt in the expected functionality.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced alongside the data update to pinpoint the source of these anomalies. Focus on areas related to 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues', 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'superiorAndDeputy empty'. Review logs and error messages for clues. Consider reverting the recent changes or implementing targeted fixes based on the identified issues."
