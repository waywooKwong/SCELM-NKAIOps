	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly changed after the update, indicating potential issues. For instance, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has narrowed down to [0.0,0.0], suggesting a possible decrease in policy loading. Similarly, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show a shift in their ranges, indicating potential problems in data processing or retrieval.  'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit changes in their ranges, hinting at potential issues with authentication or backup processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes in the affected KPIs and identify the root cause. Review recent code changes and configurations to pinpoint the source of the issue. Analyze logs and system metrics for further insights. Once the root cause is identified, implement appropriate fixes and retest the system to ensure stability and performance."
