	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in the data ranges for several KPIs after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a drastic reduction in their range, indicating potential issues with data collection or processing. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit changes in both mean and range, suggesting potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following areas to pinpoint the root cause:\n* **Data Collection:** Verify the data collection mechanisms for 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'. Check for any configuration changes or errors that might have impacted data ingestion.\n* **Performance Bottlenecks:** Analyze the performance metrics for 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify potential bottlenecks or resource constraints.\n* **Code Changes:** Review the code changes introduced alongside the metric shift to identify any potential regressions or unintended consequences."
