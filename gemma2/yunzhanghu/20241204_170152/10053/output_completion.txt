	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drops to a range of [0.0,0.0], indicating a potential issue with policy loading. Other KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' exhibit shifts in their ranges and trends, suggesting potential performance or functionality issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and other affected KPIs. Review recent code changes, configuration updates, and system logs for potential clues. Monitor the affected systems closely and gather additional metrics to pinpoint the source of the problem."
