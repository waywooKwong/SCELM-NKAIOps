	"reason": "Multiple KPIs show significant deviations in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' exhibit a narrowing range, suggesting potential issues with data processing or access. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' show upward trends in their means, indicating potential performance bottlenecks or resource contention.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the impact of the change on data pipelines**: Review the code changes and configurations related to data processing and access for KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'. 2. **Monitor resource utilization**: Track CPU, memory, and network usage for affected services and components. Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation. 3. **Analyze logs and error messages**: Examine logs for any errors or warnings related to the affected KPIs. This can provide valuable insights into the root cause of the issues. 4. **Implement monitoring and alerting**: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect anomalies and potential failures in the KPIs. 5. **Rollback the change**: If the issues are severe and the impact is significant, consider rolling back the change and investigating alternative solutions."
