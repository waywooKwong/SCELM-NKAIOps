	"reason": "The metrics show a significant decline in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  This indicates a potential issue with the deployed changes, impacting system stability and performance. KPIs like 'sum( increase(std_grpc_server_handled_total{job=\"be/yid\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\", grpc_code=\"OK\"}[1m]))' and 'approve status error' exhibit a downward trend, suggesting increased latency and potential errors in the approval process.  'svc.ApproveCallback failed' also shows a negative impact, pointing to failures in the callback mechanism.",
	"solution": "1. **Roll back the recent changes:** This is the most immediate step to mitigate the negative impact. 2. **Investigate the code changes:** Thoroughly review the code changes introduced to identify the root cause of the performance degradation and errors. 3. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze system logs for any error messages or unusual activity that occurred around the time of the change. 4. **Test the changes in a staging environment:** Before deploying any changes to production, ensure they are thoroughly tested in a staging environment to identify and address potential issues."
