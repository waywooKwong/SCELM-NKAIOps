	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change. Notably, KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' have gone from wide ranges to extremely narrow ranges with a value of 0. This suggests a potential issue with data collection or processing. Additionally, KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' show a change in trend from down to up, indicating a potential shift in the system's behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the data collection and processing pipelines for the affected KPIs. Examine logs and monitoring data to identify any errors or anomalies. Review recent code changes to pinpoint potential causes for the trend shifts. Consider reverting the recent changes if they are suspected to be the primary cause of the issues."
