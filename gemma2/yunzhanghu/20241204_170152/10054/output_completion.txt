	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has become extremely limited, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show altered trends and ranges, suggesting disruptions in object management and authorization processes. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:** Determine the cause of the limited policy loading and ensure policies are being correctly applied. 2. **Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**:  Review recent code changes or configurations that might have affected these processes. 3. **Monitor system logs and performance metrics:** Identify any errors or performance bottlenecks related to these affected KPIs. 4. **Rollback the recent changes if possible:** If the issue is confirmed to be related to the modification, consider reverting the changes and analyzing the impact further."
