	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, build <:*:>, message",
	"reason": "There are significant changes in the data ranges and trends of several KPIs after the change. For example, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range and mean, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. Similarly, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit upward trends in their means, suggesting potential performance improvements but also requiring further investigation. 'build <:*:>' and 'message' show mixed trends, potentially indicating underlying system instability. ",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the reduced range and mean in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and ensure policies are being loaded correctly. 2. Monitor the performance improvements in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' closely and identify any potential bottlenecks. 3. Analyze the mixed trends in 'build <:*:>' and 'message' to pinpoint the source of instability and implement necessary corrective actions. 4. Implement logging and monitoring to track the performance of these KPIs in real-time and identify any future anomalies."
