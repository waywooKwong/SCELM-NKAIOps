	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' have drastically reduced ranges, indicating potential issues with data loading or processing.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show notable changes, suggesting potential problems with department management or authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Focus on areas related to data loading, department management, and authentication. Review logs and error messages for further clues. Consider rolling back the changes if the impact is severe and a quick fix is not immediately available."
