	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "superiorAndDeputy empty,  approve status error, <:REQ:>, DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>, svc.ApproveCallback failed",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'superiorAndDeputy empty', 'approve status error', '<:REQ:>' and 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>' exhibit a downward trend in their mean values, indicating potential issues with data processing or system performance. Additionally, 'svc.ApproveCallback failed' shows a decrease in its mean value, suggesting potential problems with callback functionality.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI:**  Examine the data source and processing logic to identify why the values are decreasing. Potential causes include data corruption, missing data, or incorrect filtering. 2. **Analyze the 'approve status error' KPI:** Review error logs and system configurations to pinpoint the root cause of the increased errors. This might involve checking for issues with authentication, authorization, or database connectivity. 3. **Review the '<:REQ:>' and 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>' KPIs:** Analyze the data flow and processing steps involved in these KPIs. Look for bottlenecks, performance degradation, or logic errors that could be contributing to the negative trend. 4. **Debug the 'svc.ApproveCallback failed' issue:** Trace the execution flow of the callback function and inspect logs for any errors or exceptions. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are available and functioning correctly. 5. **Monitor system resources:** Keep an eye on CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify any resource constraints that might be impacting system performance."
