	"reason": "The data ranges of many KPIs have significantly changed after the update, indicating a potential issue. KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a decrease in their mean values and a smaller range, suggesting a potential decrease in request rate or module performance. 'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' also show changes in their ranges, indicating potential issues with error rates or backup operations. 'get metadata from header' shows a similar trend with a smaller range.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during the update to identify the root cause of these anomalies. Analyze logs and system metrics related to the affected KPIs to pinpoint the source of the issues. Consider reverting the changes or implementing corrective measures to restore the KPIs to their expected ranges."
