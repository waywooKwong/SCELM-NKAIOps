**Explanation:**

* **change_type: normal** - The provided data shows fluctuations and some reduced ranges, but there's no clear indication of a catastrophic failure. The anomalies could be due to various factors and require further analysis.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  I've selected KPIs with significant changes in range or trend, excluding those named "build" as per your instruction. 
* **reason:** The explanation emphasizes that the changes are not immediately indicative of a failure. It suggests a need for further investigation to understand the impact of these changes.
* **solution:** Since the situation isn't classified as a failure, no specific solution is provided. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific KPI or aspect of the data.
