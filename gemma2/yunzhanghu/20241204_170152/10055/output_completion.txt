	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to a constant 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit unusual trends, suggesting problems with object retrieval, department management, and authentication processes. These anomalies collectively point towards a systemic failure.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue. Review policy configuration and deployment processes. Analyze logs and error messages related to object retrieval, department management, and authentication. Consider rolling back the change or implementing a temporary workaround to mitigate the impact."
