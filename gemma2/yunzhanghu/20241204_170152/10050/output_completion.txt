	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>,computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu,getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several key KPIs have significantly shifted after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction to zero, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit changes in both minimum and maximum values, suggesting problems with object retrieval and backup operations. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a downward trend with a reduced range, possibly affecting authentication processes.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the zero value for 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and ensure policies are being loaded correctly. 2. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' to identify the root cause of object retrieval and backup issues. 3. Review the authentication logic related to 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to understand the impact of the reduced range and implement necessary adjustments."
