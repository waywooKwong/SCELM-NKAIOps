	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' show a drastic decrease in minimum and maximum values, suggesting a problem with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit significant changes in their ranges, implying potential disruptions in data retrieval or processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue**: Examine the policy loading process and identify any errors or bottlenecks that may be causing the decrease in loaded policies. 2. **Review the affected data retrieval and processing logic**: Analyze the code and configurations related to KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the source of the range shifts. 3. **Roll back the recent changes**: If the issue persists, consider reverting the changes to the previous state and isolating the problematic code modifications."
