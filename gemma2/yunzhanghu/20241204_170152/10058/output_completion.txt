	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, message",
	"reason": "Several key metrics exhibit significant changes after the update, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'  drop to zero, suggesting a possible service disruption or configuration problem. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' shows a narrowing range, which might indicate a change in departmental structure or resource allocation. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' also drops to zero, pointing to a potential failure in loading configuration data. 'message' shows a shift in its range, potentially indicating altered communication patterns or unexpected errors.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following: \n1. **'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'**:  Check for any configuration changes or service outages related to these metrics. Ensure the necessary services are running and configured correctly.\n2. **'Depts only have yunzhanghu'**: Analyze the departmental structure and resource allocation to understand the cause of the range narrowing. \n3. **'loadRegoMySQLInterval success'**: Examine the configuration loading process and identify any errors or issues with the MySQL database.\n4. **'message'**: Analyze the message logs for any error messages or unusual patterns that could explain the shift in range."
