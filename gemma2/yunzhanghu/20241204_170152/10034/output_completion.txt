	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in data range, suggesting a possible policy loading failure. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit a change in trend and increased data range, potentially indicating problems with department management or backup processes. 'message' shows a negative shift in the mean value and reduced data range, suggesting communication or error handling issues. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' while showing an upward trend, has a reduced data range, possibly indicating changes in user authentication behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following areas:\n* **Policy Loading:** Examine the logs and configuration related to policy loading to identify the cause of the reduced range in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and implement necessary fixes.\n* **Department Management:** Review the processes and configurations for 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' to understand the reasons for the trend and range changes. Address any identified issues.\n* **Communication and Error Handling:** Analyze the logs and error reports for 'message' to pinpoint the source of negative shifts and implement solutions to improve communication and error handling.\n* **Authentication Behavior:** Monitor the behavior of 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and investigate any anomalies or changes in user authentication patterns. Ensure appropriate security measures are in place."
