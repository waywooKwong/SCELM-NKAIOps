	"reason": "The data ranges of several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly narrowed after the change. This suggests a potential issue with the change implementation, as it has likely impacted the normal operation of the system. KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a downward trend in their means and a reduction in their ranges, indicating a decrease in system activity or potential errors.  'callback status error', 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' and 'get metadata from header' also show changes in their ranges, suggesting potential issues with specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes**: Carefully examine the code changes implemented to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences that might be affecting the KPIs. 2. **Monitor system logs**: Analyze system logs for any errors or warnings that occurred around the time of the change. This can provide valuable insights into the root cause of the issue. 3. **Rollback the changes**: If possible, temporarily rollback the changes to revert to the previous state and observe the impact on the KPIs. This can help confirm whether the changes are indeed responsible for the observed issues. 4. **Test the changes thoroughly**: Before deploying any changes, ensure that they are thoroughly tested in a staging environment to identify and address potential issues before they impact production systems. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting**: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to track the KPIs and receive notifications when they deviate from expected values. This can help identify issues early on and prevent them from escalating."
