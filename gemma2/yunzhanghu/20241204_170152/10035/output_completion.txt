	"reason": "While some KPIs show changes in their ranges and trends after the change, these changes don't necessarily indicate a failure.  For example, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shifted to a narrower range with a mean of 0, which could be a result of successful policy loading. Other KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show upward trends, suggesting potential improvements. It's important to analyze the context and specific application to determine if these changes are truly anomalies or expected behavior.",
	"solution": "No specific solution is required at this time. Further investigation into the context and application of each KPI is recommended to understand the significance of the observed changes."
