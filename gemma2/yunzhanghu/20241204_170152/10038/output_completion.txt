	"reason": "The data ranges of several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly shifted after the change. Notably, KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a drastic reduction in minimum values and an expansion in the maximum values, indicating potential issues with policy loading and object retrieval.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' exhibit similar trends, suggesting broader performance degradation across multiple systems.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these changes. This could involve: \n\n* **Reviewing recent code changes:** Identify any modifications that might have impacted the affected systems or APIs.\n* **Monitoring system logs:** Analyze logs for error messages or unusual activity around the time of the change.\n* **Profiling system performance:** Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks or resource contention.\n* **Comparing configurations:** Ensure that configurations before and after the change are consistent.\n* **Testing affected functionalities:**  Conduct thorough testing to reproduce the observed issues and gather more detailed information."
