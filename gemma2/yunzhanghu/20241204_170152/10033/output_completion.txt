	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>,' 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end,' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show drastic reductions in their minimum values and expansions in their maximum values, suggesting potential disruptions in policy loading, object ID retrieval, and department management. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit similar trends, implying problems with backup employee retrieval and authentication list operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced with the change to pinpoint the exact source of the issues affecting these KPIs. 2. **Monitor logs and error messages:** Analyze system logs and error messages for any clues related to the affected processes. 3. **Roll back the changes:** If possible, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state and gather further insights. 4. **Test and debug:** Implement thorough testing and debugging procedures to identify and fix the root causes of the anomalies."
