	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit wider ranges and shifted trends, suggesting potential problems with object ID retrieval and department management. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a drastic shift in its range, indicating potential database performance issues. 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' also indicates a change in network traffic patterns.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropping to 0. Review policy loading processes and configurations. 2. Analyze the wider ranges and trend shifts in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to identify potential issues with object ID retrieval and department management. 3. Monitor and troubleshoot 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' for database performance bottlenecks. 4. Analyze the changes in network traffic patterns indicated by 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8'. Check for resource contention or network issues."
