	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit unusual behavior after the change, indicating potential performance regressions and data inconsistencies. The `loadRegoMySQLInterval success` KPI shows a significant decrease in mean value, suggesting issues with MySQL interactions. Similarly, `superiorAndDeputy empty` and `approve status error` KPIs have abnormal trends, pointing towards potential errors in data processing or logic. ",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation in `loadRegoMySQLInterval success`. This could involve analyzing database query logs, optimizing SQL queries, and checking for resource bottlenecks.\n2. Examine the data flow related to `superiorAndDeputy empty` and `approve status error` KPIs to identify any inconsistencies or errors in data handling. Review relevant code and configurations.\n3. Conduct thorough testing after addressing the identified issues to ensure the stability and accuracy of the system."
