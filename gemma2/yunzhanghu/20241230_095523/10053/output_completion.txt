	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,  sum(value) by (region), message, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from the expected behavior. Several KPIs like AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, sum(value) by (region), message, and computeOwnObjectIDs end show abnormal values, suggesting potential issues with authentication, data retrieval, or system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> KPI:** Analyze log files and user activity to identify the cause of the deviation. 2. **Review getBackupEmp success metrics:** Check backup logs and ensure successful backups are occurring. Troubleshoot any errors reported. 3. **Analyze sum(value) by (region) data:** Identify regions experiencing performance issues or high resource consumption. Optimize resource allocation and investigate potential bottlenecks. 4. **Monitor message KPI closely:**  Examine error messages and application logs for patterns indicating system instability or failures. 5. **Investigate computeOwnObjectIDs end metrics:** Analyze database queries and object access patterns to identify potential performance degradation or data inconsistencies."
