	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "The top 5 abnormal kpis are: getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals several KPIs demonstrating significant deviations from their expected patterns. Key indicators like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show a noticeable decline in performance post-change. Additionally, the 'message' KPI exhibits an upward trend which is not aligned with typical behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'**: Analyze logs and system resources for these KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of performance degradation. 2. **Review recent code changes**:  Scrutinize any modifications made around the time the anomalies emerged, focusing on potential impacts on these KPIs. 3. **Monitor 'message' KPI closely**: While its upward trend might not be immediately critical, continued observation is necessary to understand if it signifies a developing issue."
