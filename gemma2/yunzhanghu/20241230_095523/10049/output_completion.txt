	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,computeOwnObjectIDs end,message,sum(requests)",
	"reason": "Several KPIs related to  authentication, object retrieval, and system performance have shown significant deviations from expected patterns. This suggests potential issues with resource contention, code execution errors, or external service disruptions.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the `getBackupEmp success` KPI:** Analyze logs and error messages to pinpoint the cause of failures in this process. 2. **Review `AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>` performance:** Examine authentication configurations and user access patterns for potential bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. 3. **Monitor `computeOwnObjectIDs end`:** Identify resource usage spikes during object retrieval operations and optimize storage or query logic. 4. **Analyze the `message` KPI:** Trace message processing flows to identify any slowdowns, errors, or overloaded queues.  5. **Investigate `sum(requests)` for potential high load scenarios.**  Adjust system capacity or implement caching mechanisms as needed."
