	"reason": "Several KPIs indicate potential issues.  'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' show a decrease in performance. 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'sum(requests)' show unexpected fluctuations. This suggests there might be bottlenecks or errors impacting certain operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the logs for 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' to identify specific error messages or performance bottlenecks.** 2. **Monitor the resource usage (CPU, memory) of relevant services during periods when 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'sum(requests)' show unusual behavior.** 3. **Review recent code changes or configurations that might have introduced these issues.** 4. **Consider implementing caching mechanisms or optimizing database queries to improve performance for frequently accessed data.**"
