	"reason": "The data indicates a significant deviation from the expected normal behavior.  Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit anomalies, suggesting potential issues within the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI**: Analyze the logs and error messages associated with this KPI to identify the root cause of the failures. 2. **Review the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI**: Examine the authentication process and any recent changes that might be impacting performance. 3. **Examine the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPI**:  Look for bottlenecks or inefficient queries related to object ID retrieval. 4. **Analyze the 'message' KPI**: Inspect the nature of the messages being processed and identify any potential errors or issues with message handling. 5. **Thoroughly analyze 'sum(getBackupEmp success)'**: This KPI appears to be repeatedly failing, requiring dedicated investigation to pinpoint the source of the problem."
