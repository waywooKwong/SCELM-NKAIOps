	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, sum(getBackupEmp success), getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data analysis indicates significant deviations from expected patterns in several key performance indicators (KPIs). Notably, 'message' shows a trend shift towards higher values after the change, suggesting potential communication bottlenecks or increased workload. Similarly, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibits a decline in performance, indicating possible authentication issues or resource contention. The KPIs related to backups ('getBackupEmp success') and object management ('computeOwnObjectIDs end') also display anomalies, hinting at problems with data persistence or retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies by examining logs, system resource utilization, and network traffic. Focus on areas like authentication mechanisms, backup processes, and database performance.  Consider implementing monitoring solutions to track these KPIs in real-time and proactively identify potential issues. Optimize system configurations, allocate additional resources if necessary, and explore alternative solutions for critical functionalities."
