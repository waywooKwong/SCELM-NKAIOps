	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "superiorAndDeputy empty, container_memory_rss, approve status error,  container_network_tx, container_network_rx",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations from normal patterns. Several KPIs related to memory usage, network traffic, and task approval are experiencing anomalies. This suggests potential resource contention, network issues, or problems with the task processing pipeline.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the `superiorAndDeputy empty` KPI for potential issues with hierarchy configurations or data loading.\n2. Monitor memory usage (`container_memory_rss`) closely and consider increasing allocated resources if necessary.\n3. Analyze the `approve status error` KPI to identify the root cause of approval failures and implement corrective actions.\n4. Examine network traffic metrics (`container_network_tx`, `container_network_rx`) for bottlenecks or unusual patterns.\n5. Review logs and system events for further insights into the anomalies."
