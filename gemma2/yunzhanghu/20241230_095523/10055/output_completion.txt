	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from the expected behavior. Several KPIs, including AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and 6.0, exhibit abnormal spikes or drops indicating potential system issues.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies.  This could involve examining logs, monitoring resource utilization, and reviewing recent code changes. Based on the identified cause, appropriate actions such as code fixes, configuration adjustments, or infrastructure upgrades can be implemented to resolve the issues."
