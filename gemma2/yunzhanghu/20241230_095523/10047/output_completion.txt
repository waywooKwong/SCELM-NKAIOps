	"solution": "Investigate the affected systems and components to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Analyze logs, system performance metrics, and user activity patterns to identify any potential bottlenecks, errors, or configurations that may be contributing to the observed issues. Implement necessary fixes and monitor the situation closely after applying changes."
