	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success,message,computeOwnObjectIDs end,sum(requests)",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant deviation from normal operating patterns. Multiple KPIs, including AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and sum(requests), exhibit unusual spikes or drops. This suggests potential performance issues, resource contention, or unexpected application behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the anomalous KPIs:**  Deep dive into the specific logs and metrics for AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and sum(requests) to pinpoint the root cause of their deviations. 2. **Monitor resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage during the periods of abnormal activity. Identify potential bottlenecks or overloads. 3. **Review application logs:** Examine application logs for any errors, warnings, or unusual events that might correlate with the KPI anomalies. 4. **Consider recent changes:**  If significant system changes (e.g., deployments, configurations) occurred recently, investigate their impact on these KPIs. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Establish robust monitoring systems with alerts to proactively detect future deviations from normal behavior."
