	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeDeptAllSuccess ",
	"reason": "The metrics data for several KPIs show significant deviations from expected patterns. Some KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success' and 'message' indicate performance degradation while others like 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibit unexpected spikes in values. These anomalies suggest potential issues with system stability, resource utilization, or data processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the impacted systems:**  Dive deeper into logs and monitoring data for the KPIs identified as abnormal to pinpoint the root cause of the deviations. 2. **Resource Monitoring:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage on affected systems to identify potential resource bottlenecks or contention. 3. **Code Review:** Examine recent code changes related to the affected systems to rule out any regressions introduced by new deployments. 4. **Database Performance:** Analyze database query performance and identify potential slow queries that could be contributing to the issues.  5. **Alerting System:** Configure alerts for critical KPIs to proactively detect future anomalies."
