	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant increase in request latency and error rate, coupled with a decrease in throughput. This suggests potential performance bottlenecks or issues within the system.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased latency and errors. Analyze system logs, resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory), and network traffic to identify potential bottlenecks. Consider scaling resources, optimizing application code, or addressing infrastructure issues."
