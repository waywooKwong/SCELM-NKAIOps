	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(getBackupEmp success) , AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, sum(message), computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeDeptObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data analysis shows that several key performance indicators (KPIs) have experienced significant deviations from their normal ranges. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success' has shown a decrease in performance, while 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  exhibits fluctuations beyond acceptable limits. Additionally, 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeDeptObjectIDs end' have indicated anomalies in their trends. These deviations suggest potential issues with system stability, resource utilization, or data integrity.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation in 'getBackupEmp success'.** This may involve analyzing logs, monitoring system resources during backup operations, and reviewing error messages. 2. **Analyze the fluctuations in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify potential triggers.**  This could involve examining user activity patterns, network traffic, or application logs. 3. **Monitor the anomalous trends in 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeDeptObjectIDs end' closely.** Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of any further deviations. 4. **Review system configurations and resource allocation.** Ensure sufficient resources are available for critical processes and that no bottlenecks are causing performance issues."
