	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate several key performance indicators (KPIs) are exhibiting significant deviations from normal behavior. KPIs like container_memory_rss and approve status error show increased errors and potentially high memory consumption. The superiorAndDeputy KPI has also deviated significantly, suggesting possible issues in hierarchical data or processes. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the container_memory_rss issue:** Analyze resource usage patterns, identify memory-intensive tasks, and consider optimizing application code or scaling resources. \n2.  **Review approve status error logs:** Diagnose the root cause of approval errors, address any system bottlenecks or configuration issues. \n3. **Examine superiorAndDeputy data:** Trace the source of the deviation, verify hierarchical relationships, and ensure data integrity."
