{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(requests) by (status)",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs show significant deviations from expected behavior. AuthListByName shifted from an upward trend to a downward one with reduced values. getBackupEmp success and computeOwnObjectIDs end exhibit narrowing ranges, suggesting potential performance issues. The message KPI shows increased negative values, indicating potential errors or failures.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the AuthListByName issue:** Analyze recent changes related to Chinese information handling and identify the cause of the trend shift. 2. **Monitor getBackupEmp success and computeOwnObjectIDs end closely:**  Profile these functions to pinpoint bottlenecks or resource contention. Optimize code and configurations if necessary. 3. **Examine the reasons behind negative values in the message KPI:** Analyze error logs and system events to understand the nature of these errors and implement corrective measures. Consider implementing robust logging and monitoring strategies for better issue identification and resolution."
