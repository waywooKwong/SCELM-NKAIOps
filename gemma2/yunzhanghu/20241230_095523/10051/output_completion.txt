	"solution": "Investigate the following areas:\n* **getBackupEmp success**: Analyze logs and system resources to identify bottlenecks or errors during backup processes.\n* **AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message**: Review authentication mechanisms and messaging systems for potential vulnerabilities or performance degradation.\n* **sum(requests)**, **404 error rate**: Monitor request volume and error rates to pinpoint overloaded services or faulty routing configurations. \n* Implement appropriate logging and monitoring to track these KPIs in real-time and proactively address emerging issues."
