	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  message,   620 ",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges after the change. This indicates potential issues with data processing, system performance, or underlying dependencies.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the affected KPIs:** Analyze the specific metrics and trends for 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end',  'message', and 620 to pinpoint the root cause of the deviations.\n2. **Review recent changes:** Examine any code modifications, configuration updates, or infrastructure adjustments made around the time of the change to identify potential culprits.\n3. **Monitor system logs and metrics:** Scrutinize logs for error messages and performance indicators to gain further insights into the behavior of affected systems.\n4. **Rollback if necessary:** If the impact is severe, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous stable state while investigating the issue thoroughly.\n5. **Implement robust monitoring and alerting:** Establish comprehensive monitoring mechanisms with appropriate thresholds and alerts to proactively detect future anomalies."
