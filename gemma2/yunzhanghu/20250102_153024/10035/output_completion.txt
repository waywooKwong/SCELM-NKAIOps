	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(requests_per_second) by (method), sum(latency_ms) by (status_code), error_rate by (path),  count(unique_users) over time, count(distinct sessions) over time",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant performance degradation and increased errors. Specifically, the request rate has increased substantially, latency is higher than normal, error rates are elevated for certain paths, and the number of unique users and distinct sessions have decreased.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the increased request load and implement measures to optimize resource utilization (e.g., caching, content delivery networks). 2. Analyze error logs to identify the specific issues causing errors and fix them. 3. Monitor key performance indicators closely and adjust system configurations as needed. 4. Consider scaling infrastructure resources if necessary."
