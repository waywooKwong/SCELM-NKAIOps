	"reason": "Several KPIs, including container memory usage, approval status errors, and  superiorAndDeputy metrics show significant deviations from normal ranges. This suggests potential resource contention, process bottlenecks, or configuration issues.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of high container memory usage by examining resource allocation and application behavior.\n2. Analyze approval status error logs to identify recurring patterns and implement corrective actions.\n3. Review the 'superiorAndDeputy' metric definition and ensure its accuracy and relevance.\n4. Monitor system resource utilization closely and adjust configurations as needed."
