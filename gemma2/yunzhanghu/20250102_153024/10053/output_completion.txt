	"reason": "The provided metrics show significant deviations from normal patterns. Multiple KPIs related to system performance, resource utilization, and authentication are experiencing anomalies. This suggests potential issues with system load, resource contention, or security configurations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the 'AuthListByName' anomaly.** Review authentication logs and system configurations for any unusual activity or misconfigurations.\n2. **Monitor resource consumption closely.** Analyze CPU and memory usage metrics to identify potential bottlenecks or excessive workload on specific containers or nodes.\n3. **Optimize system configurations.** Adjust resource allocation, network settings, and caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce contention.\n4. **Implement logging and monitoring enhancements.** Increase the granularity of logs and implement proactive alerting to detect and address issues promptly."
