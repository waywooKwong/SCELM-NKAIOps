	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "computeOwnObjectIDs end,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success,message,sum(requests)",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided metrics reveals several key indicators pointing towards a system failure.  The `computeOwnObjectIDs end`, `AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>`, and `getBackupEmp success` KPIs show significant deviations from their expected behavior. The `message` KPI indicates an increase in error messages, further suggesting underlying issues. The elevated values of these KPIs collectively suggest a performance bottleneck or potential resource exhaustion within the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Resource Utilization:** Analyze CPU, memory, and network utilization to identify potential bottlenecks. 2. **Review Logs:** Thoroughly examine system and application logs for any error messages or patterns that could shed light on the root cause. 3. **Optimize Queries:** Analyze SQL queries, especially those related to `computeOwnObjectIDs end` and `AuthListByName`, to identify opportunities for optimization. 4. **Scale Resources:** If resource contention is identified, consider scaling up server resources or distributing workloads across multiple instances. 5. **Monitor System Health:** Implement comprehensive monitoring systems to track key metrics and proactively detect potential issues."
