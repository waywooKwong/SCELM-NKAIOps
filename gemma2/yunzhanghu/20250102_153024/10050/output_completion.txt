	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeDeptMembers end ",
	"reason": "The provided KPI data shows significant deviations from expected patterns. Several KPIs, including 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'message', exhibit anomalous trends with spikes or drops outside normal ranges.  This suggests potential underlying issues with data processing, system performance, or external factors influencing these functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the affected services:** Analyze logs and system metrics for the services related to the abnormal KPIs (e.g., backup service, authorization service, messaging queue). 2. **Review recent changes:** Check for any recent code deployments, configuration updates, or infrastructure modifications that could have introduced these anomalies. 3. **Monitor resource utilization:** Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network) are available to the affected services. 4. **Correlate with external factors:** Look for potential correlations between the anomalies and external events like network outages, database issues, or user activity spikes."
