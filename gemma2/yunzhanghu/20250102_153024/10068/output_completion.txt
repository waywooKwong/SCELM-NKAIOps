{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loadRegoMySQLInterval success, parseDataReportFlag ok, approve status error, superiorAndDeputy empty,  parseDataReportFlag ok",
	"reason": "The data indicates significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. These include: loadRegoMySQLInterval success, showing a shift in successful intervals; parseDataReportFlag ok, indicating potential issues with parsing data reports; approve status error, suggesting problems with approval workflows; and superiorAndDeputy empty, pointing to inconsistencies in hierarchical relationships.  These anomalies suggest that the implemented change may have unintended consequences and requires further investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the anomalies:** Analyze logs and system metrics related to the affected KPIs to pinpoint the specific source of the issues. 2. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications introduced with the recent update to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences. 3. **Roll back the change:** Consider reverting the change temporarily while investigating the root cause. This will help isolate the issue and minimize further impact. 4. **Implement targeted fixes:** Once the root cause is identified, develop and implement specific solutions to address the anomalies. 5. **Conduct thorough testing:** After implementing fixes, perform rigorous testing to ensure the stability and functionality of the system."
