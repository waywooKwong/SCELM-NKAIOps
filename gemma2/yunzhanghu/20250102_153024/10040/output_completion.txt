	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from normal behavior. Several KPIs, such as 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', are experiencing an upward trend in their values, indicating potential performance degradation or increased resource consumption.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these abnormal trends. Analyze logs, monitor system resource utilization, and review recent code changes to identify any potential bottlenecks or issues causing these deviations. Consider implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms for these KPIs to proactively detect future anomalies."
