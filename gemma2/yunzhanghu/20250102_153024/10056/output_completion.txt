{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected ranges after the change. Notably, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibits a downward trend in its mean value and reduced range, while 'getBackupEmp success' shows an upward trend with a narrower range.  'message' also demonstrates a shift towards positive values. Additionally, KPIs like 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' indicate a potential issue with data consistency.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the impact of the change on the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' process.** Review recent logs and configuration changes related to this KPI. 2. **Analyze the reasons behind the increased positive values in the 'message' KPI.** This could indicate successful execution or a potential shift in message content. 3. **Examine the data consistency of the KPIs 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'.** Verify that data sources are properly synchronized and identify any potential errors in data processing."
