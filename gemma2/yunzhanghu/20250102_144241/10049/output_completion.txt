{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum  ",
	"reason": "The data shows a significant deviation from the normal range in several key performance indicators (KPIs). Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'sum' exhibit anomalies indicating potential issues with backup processes, authentication mechanisms, object retrieval, and system communication.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success' anomaly:** Examine the logs and error messages related to backups to identify the root cause of failures. Consider reviewing backup configurations and ensuring sufficient storage space.\n2. **Analyze the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  issue:** Review authentication policies and user permissions to ensure they are correctly configured. Investigate any potential security breaches or suspicious login attempts.\n3. **Troubleshooting 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' errors:** Check object storage infrastructure, network connectivity, and object retrieval processes for bottlenecks or failures. Optimize database queries and indexing to improve performance.\n4. **Address the 'message' anomaly:** Analyze message queues and communication channels for delays or errors. Investigate potential issues with message routing, processing, or delivery mechanisms.\n5. **Review the 'sum' discrepancy:** Verify data aggregation methods and ensure that all relevant data points are being included in the calculation. Identify potential data inconsistencies or missing values."
