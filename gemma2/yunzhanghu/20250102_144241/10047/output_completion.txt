	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message,  sum(requests), sum(responses),  sum(latency)",
	"reason": "The data indicates significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) including AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, sum(requests), sum(responses), and sum(latency). These anomalies suggest potential issues with authentication, data retrieval operations, communication latency, or system resource utilization.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> KPI:**  Analyze logs and trace requests to pinpoint the cause of deviations. This might involve reviewing authentication configurations, user permissions, or underlying database performance. 2. **Examine getBackupEmp success:**  Check backup processes for errors or delays. Investigate storage capacity and network connectivity to ensure efficient backups. 3. **Address message KPI anomalies:** Analyze message queues for backlog or processing issues. Optimize message handling strategies and investigate potential bottlenecks in message delivery. 4. **Monitor sum(requests), sum(responses), and sum(latency):**  Identify peak load periods and resource constraints. Consider scaling infrastructure, optimizing application code, or implementing caching mechanisms to improve performance. "
