	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "36.kpi name: AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n37.kpi name: getBackupEmp success\n40.kpi name: message\n19.kpi name:  computeOwnObjectIDs end\n28.kpi name:  getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The data analysis indicates several KPIs exhibit anomalous behavior after the change. These include AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and getBackupEmp success. The observed trends suggest potential issues with authentication list retrieval, backup employee operations, message processing, and object ID computation.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. It's recommended to examine logs, monitor system resources, and review recent code changes related to the affected KPIs. Potential solutions could involve optimizing database queries, addressing resource contention issues, or fixing bugs in the relevant code."
