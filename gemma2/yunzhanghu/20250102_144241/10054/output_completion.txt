{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, sum(requests), message, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges, indicating potential issues.  For instance, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a trend reversal and reduced values.  'getBackupEmp success' also displays a downward shift. Additionally, metrics like 'sum(requests)' and 'message' indicate unusual activity patterns.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the cause of the AuthListByName anomaly:** Examine authentication logs and Chinese information handling processes to pinpoint potential bottlenecks or errors. 2.  **Review getBackupEmp success rate:** Analyze backup procedures and identify any recurring failures or performance issues. 3.  **Monitor sum(requests) closely:** Identify unusually high request volumes and investigate the source applications or users driving this traffic. 4. **Analyze message content:** Examine messages for errors, warnings, or unusual patterns to understand potential system issues. 5. **Reconfigure computeOwnObjectIDs end:** Optimize object identification processes to reduce resource usage and improve performance."
