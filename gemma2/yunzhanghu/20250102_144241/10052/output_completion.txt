	"reason": "The provided KPI data shows significant deviations from normal patterns.  Several KPIs exhibit trends indicating potential issues with system performance and resource utilization. Notably, the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI displays a shift in mean towards negative values, suggesting potential authentication challenges. The 'getBackupEmp success' KPI also shows a decline in mean value, hinting at difficulties in backup operations.",
	"solution": "Investigate the specific cause of these anomalies. This may involve examining logs, monitoring system resources, and conducting further analysis on the identified KPIs. For instance, for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', review authentication logs to pinpoint potential access failures or configuration issues.  For 'getBackupEmp success', analyze backup logs and ensure sufficient storage space and network connectivity."
