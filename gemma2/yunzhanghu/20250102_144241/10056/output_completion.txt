	"reason": "The data analysis reveals several KPIs exhibiting significant deviations from their expected patterns. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success' shows a positive trend shift, indicating potential improvements. Conversely, 'authenticateUserByUserName', 'AuthListByName', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'getEmployeeInfo by ID' display negative trends, suggesting performance degradation or errors.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of the performance issues in 'authenticateUserByUserName', 'AuthListByName', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'getEmployeeInfo by ID'. Analyze logs, monitor system resources, and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.  Optimize database queries, refine authentication processes, and ensure sufficient hardware capacity to address these problems."
