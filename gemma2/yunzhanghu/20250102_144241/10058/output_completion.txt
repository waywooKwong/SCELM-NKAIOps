	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "36. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n37. getBackupEmp success\n38. computeOwnObjectIDs end\n40. message\n12.  getDeptNameByCode success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs showed significant deviations from normal ranges after the change, indicating potential issues. For example, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and message exhibited unusual fluctuations, suggesting underlying problems in authentication, data retrieval, or system operations.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the changes implemented recently to pinpoint the specific modifications that might have caused these anomalies.\n2. Analyze logs and error messages related to the affected KPIs (AuthListByName, getBackupEmp, computeOwnObjectIDs, message) to identify potential root causes.\n3. Review relevant configurations and settings to ensure they are consistent and aligned with expected behavior.\n4. Consider reverting the recent changes or applying targeted patches to address identified issues.\n5. Monitor the affected KPIs closely after implementing any solutions to verify their effectiveness and prevent further anomalies."
