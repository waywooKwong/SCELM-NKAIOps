	"reason": "The data indicates a significant deviation from expected patterns. Several KPIs show increased volatility and outliers, suggesting potential issues with resource utilization, authentication processes, or system stability. The 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI's performance degradation might be related to user authentication or authorization processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the impacted systems and applications. Analyze logs, monitor resource consumption (CPU, memory), and review configuration settings for potential issues. Address any identified bottlenecks or errors to restore system stability and normal operation."
