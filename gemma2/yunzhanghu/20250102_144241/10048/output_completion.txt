	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  36.kpi name",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant deviation from expected patterns in several key performance indicators (KPIs). Specifically, KPIs such as 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and others show unusual spikes or drops outside their normal ranges. This suggests potential issues with authentication, backup operations, object retrieval, and data processing.",
	"solution": "To address these anomalies, it is recommended to:\n1. **Investigate the logs and system events** related to the affected KPIs for more detailed insights into the causes of the deviations.\n2. **Review the configurations and settings** for the impacted systems and components to identify any misconfigurations or potential vulnerabilities.\n3. **Monitor the performance of relevant services and applications** closely to detect any recurring patterns or trends.\n4. **Implement appropriate safeguards and controls** to prevent similar anomalies from occurring in the future, such as setting up alerts and thresholds based on historical data."
