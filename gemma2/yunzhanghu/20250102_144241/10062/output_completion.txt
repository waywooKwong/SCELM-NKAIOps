	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_memory_rss\ncontainer_cpu_usage_seconds_total\napprove status error\nsuperiorAndDeputy empty\nbuild ",
	"reason": "The metrics data indicates a significant increase in container memory usage (container_memory_rss), CPU consumption (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total), and errors related to 'approve status' and 'superiorAndDeputy empty'. This suggests potential resource contention, application performance issues, or configuration problems.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following:\n* **Resource Contention:**  Increase memory and CPU resources allocated to containers if needed. Monitor system-wide resource utilization.\n* **Application Performance:** Review application logs for errors and bottlenecks. Optimize code for efficiency. Consider scaling applications horizontally if necessary.\n* **Configuration Issues:** Verify configuration settings related to 'approve status' and 'superiorAndDeputy empty'.  Correct any inconsistencies or misconfigurations.\n* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify potential issues before they impact service availability."
