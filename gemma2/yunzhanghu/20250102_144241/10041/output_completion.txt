{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(requests)",
	"reason": "The analyzed metrics indicate a significant deviation from the expected behavior. Several KPIs show unusually high values or fluctuations, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or system errors. For example, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibit increased response times, while 'message'  demonstrates inconsistent request patterns.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message'.** This may involve examining logs, monitoring system resources, and analyzing code for potential issues. \n2. **Optimize resource allocation and configuration.** Identify and address any bottlenecks that could be contributing to the performance degradation.  \n3. **Implement appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms.** This will help in identifying and resolving issues more effectively."
