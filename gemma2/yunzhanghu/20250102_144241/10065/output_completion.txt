	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "irate(build_success[1m]) > 0.9\nloadRegoMySQLInterval success\nsuperiorAndDeputy empty\napprove status error\nempty ",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant increase in the number of build failures, as well as anomalies in several other key metrics. These anomalies suggest potential issues with system performance, resource availability, or configuration changes.  ",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the increased build failures by analyzing logs and monitoring system resources. \n2. Review the configuration settings related to the affected kpis (loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty, approve status error).  \n3. Implement appropriate monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively identify and address future anomalies."
