Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 



Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Change Type:**  The provided output clearly states that there are no anomalies exceeding thresholds. This means the system is operating within expected parameters. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** Since there are no anomalies, there are no KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The data itself confirms a normal state. All metrics fall within acceptable ranges.
* **Solution:** With no issues detected, no solutions are necessary. 


Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
