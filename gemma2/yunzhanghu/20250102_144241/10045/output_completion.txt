	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges, indicating potential system issues. These anomalies suggest a cascade effect where changes in one area are impacting others.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the anomalies**: Begin by analyzing the logs and metrics for the top 5 abnormal KPIs to identify the specific factors contributing to the deviations.\n2. **Review recent changes**: Check for any recent deployments, configuration updates, or infrastructure modifications that might be correlated with the onset of these issues.\n3. **Monitor affected systems**: Closely observe the performance and behavior of the systems impacted by these anomalies. Identify any additional symptoms or error messages that can provide further insights.\n4. **Implement mitigation strategies**: Based on the identified root causes, implement appropriate solutions to address the anomalies. This may involve reverting recent changes, adjusting configurations, or scaling resources as needed.\n5. **Establish monitoring and alerting**: Set up robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect future anomalies promptly and minimize their impact."
