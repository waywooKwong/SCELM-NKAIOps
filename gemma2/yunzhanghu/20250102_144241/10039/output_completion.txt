	"reason": "The analysis of the provided KPI data reveals significant deviations from normal behavior. Several KPIs exhibit unusual trends, indicating potential issues within the system. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success' shows a decrease in performance, while 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' demonstrates an increase in variability.  Additionally, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method, path) * 8' show anomalies in their average values or distributions.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of these deviations by examining system logs, resource utilization, and error reports.  Focus on addressing the issues identified in the 'Top 5 abnormal kpi' as they appear to be contributing most significantly to the overall system instability."
