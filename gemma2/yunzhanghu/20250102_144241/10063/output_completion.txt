	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_memory_rss,approve status error,superiorAndDeputy empty,get request latency,parse request latency",
	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate a significant performance degradation. Several KPIs, including container_memory_rss, approve status error, and superiorAndDeputy empty, show unusually high values or deviations from their expected ranges. This suggests resource contention, potential bottlenecks in processing requests, and possible issues with the system's ability to handle its workload.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource consumption:** Analyze the container_memory_rss metric to identify processes consuming excessive memory. Consider optimizing resource allocation or scaling down unnecessary services.\n2. **Review request latency:** Examine get request latency and parse request latency for any spikes or prolonged delays. Investigate potential bottlenecks in database queries, network traffic, or code execution.\n3. **Address 'superiorAndDeputy empty' issues:**  Determine the cause of the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' anomaly. This could indicate data synchronization problems or missing information required by specific processes.\n4. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up robust monitoring systems with alerts for key performance indicators (KPIs). This will enable proactive identification of potential issues before they significantly impact system performance."
