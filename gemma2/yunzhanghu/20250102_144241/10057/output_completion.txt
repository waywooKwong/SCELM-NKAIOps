	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeDeptNameByID ",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges. Notably, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit unusual fluctuations, while 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'computeDeptNameByID' also display anomalies. This suggests potential issues with authentication, data retrieval, or system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Authentication:** Examine the logs and configurations related to 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify any errors or access restrictions that could be causing the fluctuations. 2. **Review Backup Processes:** Analyze the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI for potential bottlenecks or failures during backup operations. Check logs and system resources for clues. 3. **Monitor System Performance:**  Keep a close eye on the performance of 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'computeDeptNameByID' using monitoring tools. Identify any resource contention, slow queries, or other performance issues that may be contributing to the anomalies."
