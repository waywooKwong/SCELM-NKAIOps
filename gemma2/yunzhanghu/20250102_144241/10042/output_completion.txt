	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(requests) by (method)",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided data reveals several KPIs indicating a potential system failure. These include significant deviations in metrics like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message' , and  'sum(requests) by (method)'. This suggests that specific functionalities within the system might be experiencing performance issues or errors.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Steps could include:\n\n* **Examining logs:** Analyze system and application logs for error messages or unusual activity around the affected KPIs.\n* **Monitoring resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify potential bottlenecks.\n* **Reviewing recent changes:** Determine if any recent code deployments or configuration updates coincided with the onset of these anomalies.\n* **Testing affected functionalities:** Manually test the functionalities related to the abnormal KPIs to reproduce the issues and gather more detailed information."
