{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, sum(request), message, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs related to system performance and authentication show significant deviations from normal behavior. Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' indicate potential issues with database operations and user authorization, respectively. Additionally, metrics like 'sum(request)', 'message', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' suggest increased system load and potential bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPIs. Analyze database logs for errors or performance issues, and review user access permissions to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Monitor system resource utilization and optimize code performance to address bottlenecks indicated by metrics like 'sum(request)', 'message', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'. Implement load balancing and caching mechanisms to improve scalability and reduce response times."
