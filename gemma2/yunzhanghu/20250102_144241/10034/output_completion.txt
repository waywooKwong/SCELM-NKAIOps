	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method)",
	"reason": "Several KPIs demonstrate significant deviations from their expected behavior. 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'message' show increased variance and shifted means after the change, indicating potential issues with data processing or service performance. The  sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method) metric suggests a potential spike in requests for certain HTTP methods.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This could involve examining logs, tracing requests, and monitoring system resources closely. Potential solutions might include optimizing database queries, scaling infrastructure, or addressing any identified code defects."
