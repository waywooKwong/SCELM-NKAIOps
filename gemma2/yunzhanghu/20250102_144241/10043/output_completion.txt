	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(cpu) by (pod), sum(memory) by (pod), sum(requests_per_second) by (pod), sum(latency) by (pod), getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant spike in CPU, memory consumption, and request rate for several pods. Additionally, the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI shows an unusual decline, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or resource contention.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the top resource-consuming pods to identify the root cause of increased CPU and memory usage.\n2. Explore horizontal scaling options by adding more instances for resource-intensive applications.\n3. Optimize application code and database queries to reduce resource consumption.\n4. Monitor 'getBackupEmp success' closely and investigate potential issues with backup processes or data access."
