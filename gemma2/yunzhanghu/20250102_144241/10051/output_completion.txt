{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, sum(duration)",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'sum(duration)' exhibit notable increases or decreases in their metrics, indicating potential issues with the system's functionality or performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced during the change to pinpoint the specific areas that might be causing these anomalies. 2. **Monitor resource utilization:**  Track CPU, memory, and network usage closely to identify any resource bottlenecks or unexpected spikes that could be contributing to performance degradation. 3. **Log analysis:** Analyze system logs for error messages or warnings related to the affected KPIs. This can provide valuable insights into the root causes of the issues. 4. **Performance testing:** Conduct thorough performance tests to assess the impact of the change on the overall system behavior and identify areas for optimization."
