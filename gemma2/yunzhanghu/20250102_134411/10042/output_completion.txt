{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(receive_bytes)",
	"reason": "The data analysis indicates a significant deviation in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This suggests a potential issue with the implementation or configuration of the affected systems. The anomalies observed include spikes in latency, errors, and reduced throughput.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes**: Carefully examine the code modifications made around the time of the data shift to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences. \n2. **Monitor system logs**: Analyze server logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity that could provide insights into the root cause.\n3. **Resource utilization**: Check CPU, memory, and network usage metrics to ensure that resources are not being overloaded. Consider scaling up infrastructure if necessary.\n4. **Database performance**: Investigate database query execution times and indexing to rule out any performance bottlenecks.\n5. **Configuration review**: Verify that all relevant system configurations are correct and consistent with the expected behavior."
