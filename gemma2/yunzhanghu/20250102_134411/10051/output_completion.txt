	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,computeOwnObjectIDs end,message,sum",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from the expected range. Several KPIs, including 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'sum' demonstrate unusual fluctuations suggesting potential issues in those functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following areas to identify the root cause of the anomalies:\n- Review logs related to 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' for any error messages or unusual activity.\n- Analyze system resource usage (CPU, memory) during periods when these KPIs exhibit abnormal behavior.\n- Check for recent configuration changes or deployments that might have introduced issues.\n-  Consider scaling resources or optimizing code performance if necessary."
