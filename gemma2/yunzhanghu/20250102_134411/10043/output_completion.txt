	"reason": "Several KPIs indicate performance degradation and potential issues. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show decreased efficiency, while 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'message' exhibit increased latency or errors. The high value in 'sum(requests) by (method)' suggests overloaded resources.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of performance degradation in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message'. Optimize resource allocation and identify bottlenecks contributing to the high request volume indicated by 'sum(requests) by (method)'."
