	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_memory_rss, approve status error, superiorAndDeputy empty,  get-trace-id, get-transactionID",
	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate several anomalies. Notably, 'container_memory_rss' and 'approve status error' show significant deviations from their expected ranges. Additionally, 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'get-trace-id', 'get-transactionID' exhibit unusual trends. These fluctuations suggest potential performance bottlenecks or system issues requiring investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate memory consumption:** Analyze the processes consuming high memory in the 'container_memory_rss' metric. Identify resource-intensive applications and consider optimization strategies.\n2. **Troubleshoot 'approve status error':** Examine the workflow responsible for this KPI. Look for errors, bottlenecks, or configuration issues hindering successful approvals.\n3. **Review 'superiorAndDeputy empty' logic:**  Analyze the code or configuration responsible for populating these values. Ensure data is correctly being assigned and processed.\n4. **Monitor trace IDs and transaction IDs:** Analyze the behavior patterns in 'get-trace-id' and 'get-transactionID' to identify potential performance issues or resource contention during transactions."
