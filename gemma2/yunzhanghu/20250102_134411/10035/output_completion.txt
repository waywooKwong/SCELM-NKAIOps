	"reason": "The system is experiencing performance degradation and potential issues with authentication, data retrieval, and message handling. Several KPIs indicate increased latency, errors, or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of anomalies in the identified KPIs. Analyze logs, monitor system resources, and review recent code changes to pinpoint the source of the problems.  Consider optimizing database queries, improving code efficiency, and enhancing error handling mechanisms."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because several KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** This list highlights critical KPIs experiencing issues, excluding those named 'build' as requested.  
    * `AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>`:  Indicates potential authentication problems.
    * `computeOwnObjectIDs end`: Suggests data retrieval performance issues.
    * `getBackupEmp success`: Points to a possible problem with backup operations.
    * `message`: Hints at difficulties in message processing or delivery.
    * `sum(rate(requests_total[1m])) by (method)`:  Indicates potential performance bottlenecks related to request handling. 
* **reason:** The overall analysis suggests performance problems, authentication challenges, and potential issues with data management and communication.

* **solution:** This provides a structured approach to resolving the identified issues.
