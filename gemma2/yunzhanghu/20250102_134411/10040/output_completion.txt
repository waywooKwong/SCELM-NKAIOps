	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(1)", 
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and message are experiencing increased values, indicating potential issues with authentication, backup processes, or data processing. The 'sum(1)' KPI is also anomalous, suggesting an overall trend of unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following areas to pinpoint the root cause:\n-  Authentication system: Analyze logs and error messages related to AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> for potential authentication failures or performance bottlenecks.\n- Backup processes: Review backup logs and job execution records for getBackupEmp success to identify any errors, delays, or resource constraints.\n- Data processing pipelines: Examine the data flow for computeOwnObjectIDs end and message to detect any data corruption, inconsistencies, or processing bottlenecks.\n- System resources: Monitor system CPU, memory, and disk usage to rule out resource contention as a contributing factor."
