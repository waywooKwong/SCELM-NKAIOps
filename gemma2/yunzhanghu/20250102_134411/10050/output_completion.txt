	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal behavior in several key performance indicators (KPIs). These include increases in latency for certain operations and a decrease in throughput for others. This suggests that the system is under heavy load or experiencing resource constraints.",
	"solution": "To address these issues, consider the following:\n* **Investigate potential bottlenecks:** Identify the specific operations causing high latency and explore ways to optimize their performance.\n* **Increase resource allocation:** If resource constraints are a factor, allocate more memory, CPU, or storage to the affected systems.\n* **Implement load balancing:** Distribute workloads more evenly across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.\n* **Monitor system health:** Continuously track key metrics to identify emerging issues and take proactive steps to prevent further degradation."
