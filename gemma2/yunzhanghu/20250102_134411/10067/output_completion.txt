{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loadRegoMySQLInterval success, parseDataReportFlag ok, build <:*:>, superiorAndDeputy empty, approve status error",
	"reason": "Several KPIs have shown significant deviations from their usual patterns.  'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'parseDataReportFlag ok' are now reporting values consistently at 0, indicating potential issues with data loading or processing. 'build <:*:>' exhibits a sharp decrease in its mean value, suggesting problems in the build process. 'superiorAndDeputy empty' shows an unexpected upward trend, which might imply changes in data structure or relationships. Lastly, 'approve status error' demonstrates minor fluctuations, hinting at potential bottlenecks in the approval workflow.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the reasons behind the sudden drops in 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'parseDataReportFlag ok'. Check logs and system resources for any errors or performance issues. 2. Analyze the changes in the build process reflected by 'build <:*:>' and identify potential sources of delay or failures.  3. Examine the data structure and relationships related to 'superiorAndDeputy empty' to understand the cause of the upward trend. 4. Review the approval workflow for bottlenecks in 'approve status error' and explore ways to optimize its efficiency."
