	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "parseDataReportFlag ok\nloadRegoMySQLInterval success\nsuperiorAndDeputy empty\napprove status error\nbuild <:*:> [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ",
	"reason": "The data indicates several KPIs have significantly shifted from their expected ranges after the change, suggesting potential issues in the system's performance and functionality.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate `parseDataReportFlag ok`**: Analyze the cause of the significant drop in positive results. Review logs and monitor relevant processes for errors.\n2. **Examine `loadRegoMySQLInterval success`**: Understand why this KPI now consistently shows 0 values. Check database connection status, query performance, and potential rate limiting.\n3. **Analyze `superiorAndDeputy empty`**: Determine why the negative values have increased. Investigate data sources and logic for populating this field.\n4. **Troubleshoot `approve status error`**: Identify the reasons behind the change in mean value. Review approval workflows and logs for errors or bottlenecks.\n5. **Monitor `build <:*:> [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ]`**: Analyze the shift in values and potential outliers. Investigate performance bottlenecks in this process."
