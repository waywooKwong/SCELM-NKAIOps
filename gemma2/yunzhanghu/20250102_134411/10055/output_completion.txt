	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "36.kpi name: getBackupEmp success \n37.kpi name: AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n40.kpi name: message\n28.kpi name: computeOwnObjectIDs end\n16.kpi name:  message",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided KPI data indicates several anomalies. Specifically, KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' exhibit significant deviations from their expected behavior. This suggests potential issues within the system related to backup operations, authentication processes, object identification, and message handling.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success' KPI by examining backup logs and system configurations. 2. Review authentication policies and user access controls for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. 3. Analyze the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPI for performance bottlenecks or resource constraints that might be affecting object identification processes. 4. Monitor message queues and communication channels associated with the 'message' KPI to detect errors, delays, or excessive load."
