	"reason": "The observed data indicates a potential performance degradation and instability in the system. The significant increase in request rates, error counts, and database query durations, coupled with elevated garbage collection time and connection failures, suggests a need for further investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Optimize Application Code:** Review code for potential bottlenecks and inefficient operations. 2. **Scale Infrastructure:** Consider increasing server resources or load balancing to handle the increased traffic. 3. **Monitor Database Performance:** Analyze database queries and indexes to identify areas for improvement. 4. **Tune Garbage Collection:** Adjust garbage collection settings to minimize its impact on application performance. 5. **Investigate Connection Failures:** Identify the root cause of the database connection failures and implement appropriate solutions."
