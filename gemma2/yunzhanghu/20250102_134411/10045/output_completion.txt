	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(getBackupEmp success) , sum(AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>),  sum(computeOwnObjectIDs end), sum(message) , sum(computeOwnObjectIDs end)",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  Specifically, the KPIs 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibit anomalous trends, indicating potential system instability or errors.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the impacted systems:** Dive deeper into the specific applications or services related to these KPIs to pinpoint the source of the anomalies. 2. **Review recent changes:** Examine the code changes, configuration updates, or deployments that coincided with the data shift. 3. **Analyze logs and error reports:** Scrutinize logs for any unusual patterns, warnings, or errors that might shed light on the issue. 4. **Monitor resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify potential bottlenecks or resource exhaustion. 5. **Rollback if necessary:** If the anomalies are severe and disruptive, consider rolling back recent changes to a stable state while investigating further."
