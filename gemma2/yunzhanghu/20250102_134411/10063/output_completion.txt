{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_memory_rss,approve status error,superiorAndDeputy empty,  get_requests,parse_requests",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant increase in memory usage (container_memory_rss) and errors related to 'approve status' and 'superiorAndDeputy'. This suggests potential resource contention or issues with approval processes. Furthermore, the increase in 'get_requests' and 'parse_requests' might be causing load on the system.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of increased memory consumption by analyzing memory usage patterns and identifying resource-intensive processes. Review the approval process for potential bottlenecks or errors. Optimize code and database queries to reduce the number of 'get_requests' and 'parse_requests'. Consider scaling resources if necessary."
