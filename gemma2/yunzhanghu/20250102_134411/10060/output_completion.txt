	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges, indicating potential issues within the system. These include: \n-  'Depts only have yunzhanghu': This KPI suggests that departments are relying solely on a specific resource ('yunzhanghu') which might indicate dependency issues or lack of diversity.\n- '(sum(irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total...)) by(namespace,pod) / on (namespace,pod) (sum(container_spec_cpu_quota...))) * 100': This complex KPI likely measures resource utilization and suggests possible CPU overuse or insufficient allocation.\n- '<:GIN:>' :  This KPI might represent a specific application performance metric and its deviation could signal problems within that component.\n- 'no need or no have tags [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>': This indicates issues with tracing and logging, potentially hindering debugging and monitoring efforts.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of high CPU utilization by analyzing the complex KPI '(sum(irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total...)) by(namespace,pod) / on (namespace,pod) (sum(container_spec_cpu_quota...))) * 100'.\n2. Explore alternative resources besides 'yunzhanghu' for departments to reduce dependencies.\n3. Analyze the '<:GIN:>' KPI to pinpoint performance bottlenecks within that application component.\n4. Address tracing and logging issues indicated by 'no need or no have tags [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>]'  by ensuring proper instrumentation and data collection."
