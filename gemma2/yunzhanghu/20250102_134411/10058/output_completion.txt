	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, getBackupEmp success, message, sum(duration)",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their normal ranges after the change.  This suggests a possible impact on system performance and functionality.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', 'message', and 'sum(duration)' KPIs. 2. Analyze logs and monitoring data to identify potential bottlenecks or errors introduced by the change. 3. Roll back the recent changes if they appear to be the primary cause of the anomalies. 4.  Implement performance tuning strategies to address any identified issues."
