	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loadBalance <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success,message,computeOwnObjectIDs end,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their usual trends, indicating potential performance issues or system instability.  The 'loadBalance <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI suggests problems with network load distribution, while 'getBackupEmp success', 'message', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show increased latency or errors. The 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI's unusual fluctuations might point to authentication challenges.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of network congestion identified by the 'loadBalance <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' anomaly. This could involve analyzing network traffic patterns, optimizing server configurations, or upgrading network infrastructure.\n2.  Examine logs and monitoring data for the affected KPIs ('getBackupEmp success', 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end') to pinpoint specific errors or bottlenecks. Address these issues by implementing fixes, scaling resources, or optimizing code performance.\n3. Review authentication processes related to the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI.  Ensure secure configurations, address potential vulnerabilities, and optimize user access controls."
