	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal behavior. Several KPIs related to memory usage, resource consumption, and task completion show unusual spikes or drops. This suggests potential issues with system performance, resource contention, or faulty code execution.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource utilization**: Analyze CPU, memory, and network usage patterns to identify bottlenecks or excessive consumption. \n2. **Monitor error logs**: Scrutinize logs for errors, warnings, or exceptions that might shed light on the root cause of the anomalies.\n3. **Review code changes**: If recent code modifications were made, carefully examine them for potential regressions or unintended side effects.\n4. **Scale resources**: Consider increasing system resources (CPU, memory) if resource contention is identified.\n5. **Optimize application performance**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks within the application code."
