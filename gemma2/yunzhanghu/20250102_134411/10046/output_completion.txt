	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from the normal patterns. Several KPIs, including  'getBackupEmp success', 'authenticate', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'getDeptInfoByEmpId', and 'getEmployeeOrgById', show substantial changes in their minimum and maximum values, suggesting potential issues with user authentication, data retrieval, or system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies. This could involve reviewing logs, monitoring system resources, and checking for recent code changes that might have introduced bugs.  Focus on addressing the top 5 abnormal KPIs first as they appear to be driving the overall issue."
