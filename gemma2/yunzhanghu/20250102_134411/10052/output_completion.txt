	"reason": "The provided metrics show a significant shift in values for several KPIs after the change. Specifically, KPIs like 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' exhibit notable increases in their minimum values and decreases in their maximum values. This suggests that the change has introduced unexpected behavior or performance degradation in these areas.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these changes.  \n1. Review recent code modifications related to the affected KPIs.\n2. Analyze logs and system monitoring data for any errors or unusual activity around the time of the change.\n3. Conduct load testing to assess the impact of the change on system performance.\n4. Revert the change if it is determined to be the primary cause of the anomalies."
