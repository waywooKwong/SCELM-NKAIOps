	"reason": "The data analysis indicates a significant deviation in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the recent change. Specifically, KPIs like 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', 'superiorAndDeputy empty', 'approve status error'  show unusual fluctuations, suggesting potential issues with data processing, system loading, or workflow execution.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of anomalies:** Dive deeper into logs and monitoring data associated with the affected KPIs to pinpoint the exact source of the deviations.\n2. **Review recent code changes:**  Scrutinize recent code modifications, focusing on areas related to data processing, system calls, or workflow management. Look for potential bugs or unintended consequences.\n3. **Test and rollback:** If possible, implement targeted tests to isolate the problematic changes and consider rolling back to a stable version if necessary.\n4. **Optimize resource utilization:** Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network) are allocated to affected systems and processes to prevent performance bottlenecks.\n5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect future anomalies and facilitate faster issue resolution."

Let me break down the response:

* **`change_type: "failure"`**:  This indicates that the data analysis reveals a negative impact after the recent change.

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi:`**:  The five KPIs identified as being most responsible for this failure are listed here. I've excluded any KPIs named with 'build'.

* **`reason:`**: This section provides a plausible explanation for the observed failures based on the KPI data. It suggests potential issues like data processing errors, system load problems, or workflow disruptions.
* **`solution:`**:  This section outlines actionable steps to address the identified issues: investigating root causes, reviewing code changes, testing and rolling back, optimizing resource usage, and implementing monitoring systems.
