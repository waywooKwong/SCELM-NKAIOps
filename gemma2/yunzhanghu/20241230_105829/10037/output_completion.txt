	"reason": "The data analysis reveals a significant deviation in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the implementation of the change. This suggests that the modification has introduced unintended consequences affecting system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the affected KPIs:**  Deep dive into the `sum_rate_container_network_receive_bytes_total`, `getBackupEmp_success`, `AuthListByName_ChineseInfo_`, `computeOwnObjectIDs_end`, and `message` metrics to pinpoint the exact nature of the deviation. 2. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications implemented around the time of the data shift to identify potential root causes. 3. **Rollback or revert the change:** If possible, consider rolling back or reverting the change to restore the system to a stable state while further investigation is conducted. 4. **Monitor and analyze logs:** Analyze system logs for any errors, warnings, or unusual activity that might correlate with the observed data anomalies."
