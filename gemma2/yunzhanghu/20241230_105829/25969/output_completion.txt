Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`**  The provided output clearly states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold." This indicates a normal operational state. 

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: ""** Since there are no anomalies, there are no top abnormal KPIs to list.

* **`reason`**: The output explicitly says the data is within acceptable limits.

* **`solution`**:  A solution isn't needed because there's no issue to solve.



Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
