	"reason": "The metrics show significant increases in request and response times, along with a higher percentile (p99) latency. This indicates potential performance issues or bottlenecks in the system.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased latency.  Review application logs, monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory), and analyze database queries for potential slowdowns. Consider optimizing code, caching frequently accessed data, and scaling resources as needed."
