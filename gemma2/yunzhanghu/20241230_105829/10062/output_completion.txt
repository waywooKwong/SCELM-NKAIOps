	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum_requests,\nsum_duration,\nhttp_status_code_4xx,\nhttp_status_code_5xx,\nfailed_request_rate",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided metrics reveals a significant deviation from expected patterns. The increase in 'sum_requests' coupled with a substantial rise in 'sum_duration' indicates potential performance bottlenecks or resource constraints.  A notable surge in 'http_status_code_4xx' and 'http_status_code_5xx' signifies frequent client errors and server-side issues, respectively. Moreover, the elevated 'failed_request_rate' underscores persistent difficulties in fulfilling user requests.",
	"solution": "1. **Resource Optimization:** Investigate and optimize resource allocation (CPU, memory) to handle the increased request volume.\n2. **Performance Profiling:** Conduct thorough performance profiling to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.\n3. **Error Handling & Logging:** Enhance error handling mechanisms and implement robust logging to pinpoint the root cause of server errors and client-side issues.\n4. **Load Balancing:** Consider implementing a load balancing strategy to distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers, mitigating overload on individual instances.\n5. **Code Review & Optimization:** Conduct code reviews and optimize existing code segments to enhance efficiency and reduce response times."
