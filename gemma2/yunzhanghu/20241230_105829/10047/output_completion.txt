	"reason": "The provided data shows several KPIs with significant changes in their metrics after the change. Some KPIs, like 'sum_rate_container_network_receive_bytes_total_prometheus_monitoring_cce_bj_dev_namespace_jiesuan_pod_yid_k_s_aiops_cb_bf_tmvfd_node_metrics_path_metrics_cadvisor_m_by_pod_namespace_node_' and 'AuthListByName_ChineseInfo_', exhibit a shift in both the minimum and maximum values, indicating potential issues with network performance or authentication mechanisms. Others like 'getBackupEmp_success' and 'message' demonstrate changes in their mean values, suggesting problems with backup operations or data communication.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of these anomalies. It is recommended to:\n- Analyze logs related to network traffic, authentication processes, backup operations, and data transmission.\n- Monitor the affected systems for resource utilization, errors, and performance bottlenecks.\n- Review any recent changes made to the infrastructure or software configurations that might have contributed to these issues.\n- Consult with relevant experts to diagnose and resolve the underlying problems."
