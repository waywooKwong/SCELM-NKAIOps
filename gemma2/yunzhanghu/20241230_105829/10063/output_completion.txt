	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum_request_latency,\nsum_response_size,\nmax_request_latency,\nmin_response_size,\nnum_requests_failed",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant degradation in performance, including increased request latency, larger response sizes, and a higher number of failed requests. This suggests a potential bottleneck or issue with the underlying infrastructure or application logic.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify potential bottlenecks.\n2. **Review logs and error messages:** Analyze server logs for clues about the cause of failed requests.\n3. **Optimize code and database queries:** Identify inefficient code sections or slow database queries that may be contributing to performance issues.\n4. **Scale infrastructure:** Consider scaling up resources (e.g., servers, databases) if necessary.\n5. **Monitor and track performance:** Implement continuous monitoring to detect and address performance problems proactively."
