Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold.",
	"solution": ""
}
```  


Let me explain why the output is like this:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`** - Since the provided information states that all indicators are within acceptable thresholds, we classify this as a normal change. 

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: ""** - Because the change is classified as normal, there are no abnormal KPIs to list.

* **`reason`**:  We clearly state the reason for the classification: "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold."

* **`solution`**: There's no need to suggest a solution since there are no identified problems. 




Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
