	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "1. container_memory_rss\n2. approve status error\n3. superiorAndDeputy empty\n4.  get_trace \n5. parse_trace",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from normal patterns. Several KPIs, such as 'container_memory_rss', 'approve status error', and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' have exhibited unusual spikes and drops outside their expected ranges. This suggests potential resource contention, errors in the approval process, or unexpected behavior in the superior/deputy relationship management.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the high 'container_memory_rss' values. Consider optimizing memory usage or increasing container resources.\n2.  Analyze logs and error messages related to the 'approve status error' KPI to pinpoint the source of the issue and implement a fix.\n3. Review the logic governing the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' relationship to ensure data integrity and identify any potential bugs.\n4. Analyze trace information to understand the flow of requests and identify bottlenecks or errors.\n5.  Examine the code responsible for parsing traces and look for potential issues in the parsing logic."
