	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(request)",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs related to system performance and user interactions show significant deviations from normal behavior. These include increased latency for retrieving employee backup information, potential issues with authentication list lookups, object ID processing inconsistencies, and abnormal messaging patterns. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the getBackupEmp success KPI:**  Identify bottlenecks or errors in the backup retrieval process. Review logs and system resource utilization to pinpoint the source of the issue. 2. **Analyze AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> KPI:** Examine authentication logic and data structures for potential conflicts or inefficient queries. Optimize database access patterns and consider caching strategies. 3. **Review computeOwnObjectIDs end KPI:**  Assess object ID management processes for any inconsistencies or performance degradation. Investigate indexing strategies and data structures used for object identification. 4. **Scrutinize message KPI:** Analyze message queues, communication protocols, and application logic to identify excessive message volume, routing issues, or processing delays. Optimize message handling workflows and consider asynchronous communication patterns. 5. **Monitor system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O):** Identify any resource constraints that may be contributing to performance bottlenecks across the affected systems."
