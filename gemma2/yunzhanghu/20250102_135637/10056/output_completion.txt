	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  64k_cache_hit_rate, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected behavior. 'getBackupEmp success' has a positive trend shift, indicating potential improvement, while 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' exhibit downward trends despite a previous upward pattern.  Additionally, '64k_cache_hit_rate' demonstrates a decline suggesting cache inefficiency, and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' shows a sudden drop to zero values, possibly signaling an issue with object retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message'. Analyze the impact of the declining '64k_cache_hit_rate' and address potential cache optimization strategies.  Troubleshoot the abrupt change in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to ensure proper object retrieval functionality."
