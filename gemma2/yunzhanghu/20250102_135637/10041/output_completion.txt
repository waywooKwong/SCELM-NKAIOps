	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum_of_cpu_usage_percentage_in_last_minute",
	"reason": "The system is exhibiting several anomalies across various metrics. Notable deviations include 'getBackupEmp success' with a negative mean after the change, suggesting potential failures in retrieving backup employee information. Similarly, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show unexpected changes in their ranges, indicating possible issues with authentication and object identification processes.  'message' experiences an abrupt shift in its mean, possibly hinting at communication problems within the system. Additionally, 'sum_of_cpu_usage_percentage_in_last_minute' displays a significant increase, suggesting potential resource contention or overloaded components.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate 'getBackupEmp success' failures:** Analyze logs and error messages related to backup employee retrieval to pinpoint the root cause of the negative mean. 2. **Review authentication and object ID processes:** Examine the code and configurations for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to identify potential bugs or misconfigurations contributing to the range deviations. 3. **Monitor and optimize communication channels:** Analyze the 'message' metric further to understand the nature of communication issues and implement solutions to improve message throughput and reliability. 4. **Assess resource utilization:** Monitor system resources closely, focusing on CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O. Identify potential bottlenecks and consider scaling up infrastructure or optimizing applications to alleviate resource contention. "
