	"reason": "The data indicates a significant increase in  error_num and loaded_object_count, suggesting potential issues with system stability or resource contention. Additionally, there is an anomaly in AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, indicating potential problems with user authentication.", 
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the increased error_num**: Analyze logs and system metrics to identify the specific errors occurring and their frequency.\n2. **Monitor resource utilization**: Check CPU, memory, and network usage to ensure that resources are not overloaded. Consider scaling up infrastructure if necessary.\n3. **Review AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> logic**: Ensure that authentication processes are functioning correctly and secure. Investigate any potential vulnerabilities or configuration issues.\n4.  **Optimize database queries**: Analyze the performance of SQL queries related to loaded_object_count and identify any bottlenecks. Implement indexing and query optimization techniques to improve efficiency."
