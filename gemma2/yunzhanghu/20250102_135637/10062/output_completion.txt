	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their usual patterns, indicating potential resource contention or application performance issues. Notably, 'container_memory_rss', 'container_network_bytes_sent', and 'approve status error' exhibit unusual spikes and dips, suggesting increased memory usage, network traffic, and processing delays.  The 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI indicates a possible synchronization problem or data inconsistency.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of elevated memory consumption by analyzing container resource utilization and adjusting limits as needed.\n2. Monitor network traffic patterns to identify bottlenecks or excessive data transfer.\n3. Analyze application logs and trace requests to pinpoint performance issues related to 'approve status error'.\n4. Review code and configurations related to 'superiorAndDeputy empty' to ensure proper data synchronization.\n5.  Scale resources (CPU, memory) as needed based on observed demands."
