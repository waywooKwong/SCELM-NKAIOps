	"reason": "Several KPIs show abnormal trends after the change, indicating potential issues with data processing or system performance. For example, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' have shifted to negative trends despite previously showing positive performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced during the change to pinpoint potential bugs or logic errors affecting these KPIs.\n2. **Monitor resource usage:** Check CPU, memory, and network utilization to identify any bottlenecks or resource contention that might be causing performance degradation.\n3. **Review logs and error messages:** Analyze system logs and error messages for clues about the root cause of the anomalies. Look for patterns or recurring issues.\n4. **Test thoroughly:** Conduct comprehensive testing of affected functionalities to isolate the specific areas impacted by the changes.\n5. **Rollback if necessary:** If the issue persists, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore previous system behavior and investigate further."
