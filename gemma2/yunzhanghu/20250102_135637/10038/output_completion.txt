	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(duration) ",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs like 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit unusual trends, suggesting potential issues with authentication or data retrieval processes. Similarly, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'message'  show anomalies that might indicate bottlenecks or errors in object handling and communication. These deviations point towards a systemic failure requiring investigation and resolution.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Authentication Processes:** Analyze logs and system behavior surrounding the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI to identify potential authentication failures or performance bottlenecks.

2. **Review Data Retrieval Mechanisms:** Examine the code and configuration related to 'getBackupEmp success' for potential issues with data access, retrieval efficiency, or database connectivity.

3. **Optimize Object Handling:** Analyze the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'message' KPIs to pinpoint areas of contention or inefficiency in object processing and communication pathways. Consider optimizing resource allocation, code performance, and data structures.

4. **Monitor System Logs:**  Continuously monitor system logs for error messages, warnings, and performance alerts related to the affected KPIs. Identify recurring patterns or anomalies that provide further insights into the root causes.

5. **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Ensure that applications have robust error handling mechanisms in place to gracefully handle potential failures and prevent cascading issues."
