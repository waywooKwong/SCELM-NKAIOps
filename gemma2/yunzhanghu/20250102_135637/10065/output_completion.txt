	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant changes in their data ranges and trends after the change. Notably, 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' shows a downward trend with a reduced maximum value, indicating potential performance issues.  'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' have increased minimum values, suggesting a rise in errors or failures within those processes. The 'build <:*:>' KPI also shows changes, potentially impacting system construction.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the decreased maximum value for 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success'. This could involve examining database query performance, resource contention, or underlying infrastructure bottlenecks. \n2. Analyze the increased minimum values in 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' to identify the root causes of these errors. Review logs, system configurations, and relevant code for potential issues.\n3. Monitor the changes in the 'build <:*:>' KPI closely to ensure that the modifications haven't introduced unexpected behavior or regressions."
