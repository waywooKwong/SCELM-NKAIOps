	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "The top 5 abnormal KPIs are: getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeOwnObjectIDs end ",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided KPI data indicates a significant deviation from normal patterns. Several KPIs show an increase or decrease in their metric values beyond acceptable thresholds. This suggests potential issues within the system's performance, functionality, or resource utilization.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the `getBackupEmp success` KPI**: Determine the cause of the fluctuation and implement measures to ensure successful backups. 2. **Analyze the `AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>` KPI**:  Identify why this KPI is deviating from its expected range and address any authentication or authorization issues. 3. **Monitor the `message` KPI closely**: Investigate potential bottlenecks or errors causing the changes in message processing. 4. **Review the `computeOwnObjectIDs end` KPI**: Analyze resource usage and identify potential performance optimizations for object retrieval operations. 5. Implement comprehensive system monitoring to track these KPIs and other relevant metrics in real-time. This will enable early detection of anomalies and facilitate timely interventions."
