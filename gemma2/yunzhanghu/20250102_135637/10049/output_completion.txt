	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method), AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit significant deviations from expected behavior.  'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show decreased performance, while 'message' has an unexpected increase. The network KPI 'sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method)' also shows potential issues. Finally, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  indicates increased request latency.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of these anomalies individually. For 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', check for resource contention or database slowdowns. Analyze the 'message' KPI to identify potential bottlenecks in processing or data transmission. Examine the network traffic patterns revealed by 'sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method)' to pinpoint overloaded services or network segments. Finally, review logs and configurations related to 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to optimize its performance."
