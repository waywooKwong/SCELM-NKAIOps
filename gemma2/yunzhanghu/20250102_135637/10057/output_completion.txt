	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected ranges. For example, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows an increased mean and smaller range, potentially indicating issues with authentication processes. 'getBackupEmp success' also has a lower mean and larger range, suggesting problems with backup operations. Additionally,  'sum(requests)', 'sum(errors)' and 'sum(response_time)' exhibit abnormal behavior, pointing to potential bottlenecks or errors in system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the authentication mechanisms related to 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and identify any potential causes for the observed changes. Review backup logs and processes for 'getBackupEmp success' to pinpoint issues affecting successful backups. Analyze the patterns in 'sum(requests)', 'sum(errors)' and 'sum(response_time)' to identify performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations."
