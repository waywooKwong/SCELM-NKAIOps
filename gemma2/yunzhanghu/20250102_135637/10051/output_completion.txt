{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, sum(receive_rate), sum(send_rate)",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs indicate potential issues. AuthListByName has a significant drop in mean value and range, suggesting problems with authentication. getBackupEmp shows an increase in mean value, indicating potential backup failures. message exhibits wider fluctuations, pointing to communication disruptions. Additionally, sum(receive_rate) and sum(send_rate) are significantly affected, suggesting network performance degradation.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the AuthListByName issues by checking authentication logs and configurations. 2. Analyze getBackupEmp failures by reviewing backup logs and ensuring adequate resources. 3. Monitor message fluctuations for potential communication bottlenecks or application errors. 4. Examine network performance metrics like latency, jitter, and packet loss to identify and address network degradation. 5. Implement monitoring and alerting systems for key KPIs to proactively detect and respond to issues."
