	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeDeptObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected behavior. 'AuthListByName' exhibits an unusual decrease in mean value, suggesting potential issues with user authentication or data retrieval. Similarly, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'message' demonstrate inconsistent trends, indicating potential problems with backup operations or communication channels.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies by examining logs, system configurations, and recent code changes. Focus on areas related to user authentication, backup processes, and communication systems.  Consider implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect future issues."
