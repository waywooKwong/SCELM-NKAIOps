{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(bytes),AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,message,getBackupEmp success,computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from expected behavior.  Specifically,  'sum(bytes)' indicating network traffic spikes, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' related to user authentication, 'message' hinting at potential communication issues, and 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' suggesting problems with data retrieval and processing. This pattern suggests a possible system overload or malfunction.",
	"solution": "1. **Monitor Resource Utilization:**  Immediately analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify resource bottlenecks. 2. **Investigate Network Traffic:** Examine the source and destination of 'sum(bytes)' spikes to pinpoint congestion points. 3. **Review Authentication Logs:** Analyze 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' logs for errors or unusual activity patterns. 4. **Check Backup and Data Processing Systems:**  Scrutinize the logs of 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' for failures or delays. 5. **Scale Resources:** If necessary, increase server capacity or distribute workload to alleviate pressure on affected systems."
