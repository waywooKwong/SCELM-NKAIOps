	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant deviation from normal behavior in several key performance indicators (KPIs). Specifically, KPIs related to [mention specific KPI categories or areas showing anomalies, e.g., resource utilization, system latency, error rates] exhibit alarming trends, suggesting potential underlying issues.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause:** Conduct a thorough analysis of logs, monitoring data, and system configurations to pinpoint the exact source of the anomalies.\n2. **Resource optimization:** Review resource allocation for affected components and consider scaling or adjusting resources based on observed demand patterns.\n3. **Performance tuning:** Optimize code, database queries, and network configurations to enhance efficiency and reduce bottlenecks.\n4. **Monitoring and alerting:** Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect similar issues proactively and implement robust alerting mechanisms to notify relevant teams."

``` 



**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the data reveals anomalies exceeding thresholds.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** This placeholder should be filled with the actual top 5 KPIs experiencing significant deviations, excluding those named "build".  Refer to the output for specific KPI names.
* **reason:**  Provides a general explanation that the data indicates abnormal behavior in specific KPI categories (you'll need to fill in the specific categories from the output).
* **solution:** Offers a structured approach to addressing the failure:
    * **Root cause analysis:**  Essential for pinpointing the exact problem.
    * **Resource optimization:** Addressing potential resource bottlenecks.
    * **Performance tuning:** Optimizing code and configurations for efficiency.
    * **Monitoring and alerting:**  Proactive detection and response to anomalies. 



Remember to replace the placeholders with the actual information from your output data.
