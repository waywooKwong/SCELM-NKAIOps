	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in performance and potential anomalies across several key KPIs. This suggests a system-wide issue rather than isolated problems.",
	"solution": "1. **Deep Dive into Top 5 KPIs:** Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' metrics in detail. Identify specific data points that deviate significantly from normal patterns and pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. 2. **Resource Monitoring:** Analyze system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify potential bottlenecks or resource contention.  3. **Logging Analysis:** Review application and system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity that might correlate with the observed anomalies. 4. **Code Review:** If necessary, conduct a code review of the affected components to ensure there are no recent changes introducing bugs or performance regressions."
