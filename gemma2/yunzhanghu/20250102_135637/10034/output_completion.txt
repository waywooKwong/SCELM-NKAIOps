	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum_duration,getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,computeOwnObjectIDs end,message",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected behavior.  'sum_duration' suggests potential performance issues. 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' exhibit unusual fluctuations indicating potential failures or errors in specific operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the high 'sum_duration'.** Analyze system logs, resource utilization, and code performance to pinpoint bottlenecks. 2. **Examine the error logs related to 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message'.** This will help identify specific failures and their potential triggers. 3. **Monitor these KPIs closely and implement appropriate alerting systems.**  This allows for early detection of issues and faster response times."
