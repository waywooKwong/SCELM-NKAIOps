	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success,computeOwnObjectIDs end,message,sum_requests_latency_ms",
	"reason": "The data analysis shows that several KPIs have significant deviations from their expected patterns. Specifically, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  shows a downward trend with reduced values, indicating potential issues with authentication or user access. 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' also exhibit unusual behavior, suggesting problems in data retrieval, processing, or communication. The overall system performance seems to be affected, as indicated by the high number of anomalies.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the anomalies in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and address any authentication or authorization issues.\n2. Examine the logs and error messages related to 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' to pinpoint the source of the problems.\n3. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) closely for any bottlenecks that might be contributing to the performance degradation.\n4. Consider implementing strategies for load balancing and resource scaling to handle increased traffic or demands.\n5. Review the system architecture and design for potential vulnerabilities or inefficiencies that could be addressed through optimization."
