{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, sum(requests),  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data for several KPIs shows significant deviations from normal patterns. Specifically, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibits a downward trend despite the overall upward pattern in previous periods. Similarly, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'message' show anomalies with decreased mean values. These deviations could indicate underlying issues within the system affecting authentication processes, data retrieval, or message handling.",
	"solution": "Investigate the specific reasons behind these anomalies. This might involve analyzing logs, monitoring resource utilization, and reviewing recent code changes. Once identified, apply appropriate solutions to address the root causes. For example, if 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' is experiencing performance issues, optimize authentication logic or database queries. If 'getBackupEmp success' shows inconsistencies, verify backup procedures and data integrity. "
