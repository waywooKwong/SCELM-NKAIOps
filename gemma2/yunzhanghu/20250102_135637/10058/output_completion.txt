	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "1. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n2. getBackupEmp success\n3. sum(received)\n4. message\n5. computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their normal ranges, indicating potential system issues.  AuthListByName and getBackupEmp success show unusual fluctuations, suggesting problems in user authentication or backup processes. The increase in 'sum(received)' might point to network congestion or a surge in data requests. A notable change in the 'message' KPI suggests communication errors within the system. Finally, computeOwnObjectIDs end remaining at 0 could signal an issue with object retrieval.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate AuthListByName and getBackupEmp success**:  Analyze logs for authentication failures or backup process errors. Check user permissions and database connections.\n2. **Monitor network traffic**: Analyze 'sum(received)' to identify bottlenecks or excessive data transfer. Adjust network configurations or server resources if needed.\n3. **Examine communication logs**: Analyze the 'message' KPI fluctuations to pinpoint specific communication errors. Investigate service dependencies and resolve any connection issues.\n4. **Review object retrieval processes**:  Diagnose the cause of computeOwnObjectIDs end remaining at 0. Check for database connectivity problems or code logic errors affecting object retrieval."
