	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, message, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, sum(duration)\n",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from the normal behavior. Several KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'message' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' are experiencing unusual spikes and drops, indicating potential performance issues or errors in those specific functions.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate 'getBackupEmp success'**:  Analyze the logs and system resources during the time of the spike to identify the root cause. 2. **Examine 'message' KPI**: Check for any unusual patterns in message processing, potential bottlenecks, or errors. 3. **Review 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**: Investigate if there are changes in user authentication requests or data access patterns that could explain the fluctuation."
