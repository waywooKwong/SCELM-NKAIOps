	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibit unusual trends, indicating potential issues with data retrieval, authorization, or object handling.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the database:** Examine the database logs and schema for any errors or inconsistencies that might be affecting data retrieval in KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'.\n2. **Review authorization policies:** Analyze the authorization policies governing access to resources related to KPIs like 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to ensure proper permissions are granted.\n3. **Monitor resource utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to identify any bottlenecks or resource constraints that could be impacting performance in affected KPIs.\n4. **Implement logging and monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to capture detailed information about system events and potential errors related to the identified KPIs."
