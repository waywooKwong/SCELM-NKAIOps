	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  629\nTotal anomalies found: 629\nTotal number of anomalous kpis: 40",
	"reason": "The analysis indicates a significant deviation in key performance indicators (KPIs) post-change. KPIs like AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and message show unusual fluctuations, suggesting potential issues with authentication, data retrieval, or system communication.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the impacted systems**:  Focus on the systems related to the abnormal KPIs, such as authentication services, database servers, and messaging queues.

2. **Review recent changes**: Analyze any recent code deployments, configuration updates, or infrastructure modifications that might have triggered these anomalies.

3. **Monitor logs and error messages**: Examine system logs for errors, warnings, or exceptions related to the affected KPIs.

4. **Test and debug**: Implement targeted tests to isolate the source of the problem and perform debugging steps to identify the root cause.


5. **Roll back changes (if applicable)**: If a recent change is suspected to be the cause, consider rolling back to a previous stable state for further investigation."
