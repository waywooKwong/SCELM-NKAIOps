	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from normal patterns. Several KPIs show increased or decreased values outside expected ranges, suggesting potential performance issues or system instability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the impacted KPIs (getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeDeptList success) to identify the root cause. Monitor system logs and resource utilization for clues. Consider reviewing recent code changes or configuration updates that may have contributed to these anomalies."
