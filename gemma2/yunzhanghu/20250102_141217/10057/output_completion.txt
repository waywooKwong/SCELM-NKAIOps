{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "1. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n2. getBackupEmp success\n3. sum(requests)\n4. computeOwnObjectIDs end\n5. message",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges, indicating potential system instability or performance issues. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit increased fluctuations, while 'sum(requests)', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' display anomalous trends. These changes suggest underlying problems requiring investigation.",
	"solution": "1.  Analyze logs and system metrics related to the affected KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.\n2. Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) for potential bottlenecks or contention.\n3. Review recent code deployments or configuration changes that might have introduced these issues.\n4. Consider scaling resources or optimizing application performance if necessary.\n5. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect similar issues in the future."
