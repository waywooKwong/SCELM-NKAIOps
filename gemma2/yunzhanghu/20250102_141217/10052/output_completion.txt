{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  computeDeptObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. These include a sharp increase in the 'getBackupEmp success' metric and a decrease in the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' metric. Additionally, anomalies are observed in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'computeDeptObjectIDs end'. This suggests that the implemented changes have negatively impacted system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the impact of the recent changes on the affected KPIs.  Review logs and error messages to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigations to address the identified issues."
