	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success\ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end\nauthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\nmessage\nAuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibiting significant deviations from expected behavior. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'authListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show anomalies in their minimum, maximum, or average values. These fluctuations indicate potential issues with system performance or functionality.",
	"solution": "A thorough investigation is warranted to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This may involve examining relevant logs, monitoring system resource utilization, and analyzing recent code changes. Based on the findings, appropriate mitigation strategies can be implemented, such as optimizing database queries, addressing resource bottlenecks, or fixing faulty code."
