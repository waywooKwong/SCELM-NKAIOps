{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(requestLatency)",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided data reveals several key performance indicators (KPIs) that exhibit significant deviations from expected behavior. KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show a decrease in their mean values, suggesting potential issues with task completion or resource utilization.  Additionally, the 'message' KPI experiences a notable shift in its distribution, indicating possible communication bottlenecks or processing delays.  The overall pattern points towards performance degradation and requires further investigation.",
	"solution": "To address these anomalies, it is recommended to conduct a thorough review of the impacted systems and processes. This should include: \n\n1. **Resource Monitoring:** Analyze CPU, memory, and network resource usage to identify potential bottlenecks.\n2. **Logging Analysis:** Examine system logs for error messages or unusual patterns that may shed light on the root cause.\n3. **Performance Profiling:** Utilize profiling tools to pinpoint specific code sections causing performance issues.\n4. **Code Review:** Scrutinize relevant code segments for inefficiencies or potential bugs.\n5. **Configuration Optimization:** Adjust system configurations to enhance resource utilization and optimize performance."
