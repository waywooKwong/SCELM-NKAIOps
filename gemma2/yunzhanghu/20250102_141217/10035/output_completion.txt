	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(requests_total) by (method) * 8\nAuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\nmessage\ngetBackupEmp success\ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from expected patterns. 'sum(requests_total) by (method) * 8' indicates a spike in request volume, potentially due to increased traffic or a bug.  'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibits anomalies, suggesting authentication issues. 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' also show unusual trends, implying problems within specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the spike in request volume using tools like Prometheus to pinpoint affected endpoints. Analyze logs for errors related to authentication ('AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>') and examine the code for potential issues in the functions exhibiting abnormal behavior. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory) and adjust configurations if necessary."
