{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(received_bytes_total) by (method)",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals several anomalies in key performance indicators. Specifically, the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI shows a significant decrease in successful backups, while the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI indicates an abnormal spike in request times. Additionally, the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'message' KPIs exhibit unexpected fluctuations, suggesting potential issues within system processes. The sum(received_bytes_total) by (method) KPI also demonstrates unusual patterns, hinting at network bottlenecks or resource contention.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of decreased backup success rates in 'getBackupEmp success'.** Review backup logs and system resources to identify potential failures or errors during the backup process. 2. **Analyze the spike in request times for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**. Check authentication configurations, database queries, and load on relevant servers to pinpoint the source of the performance issue. 3. **Monitor the fluctuations in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'message' KPIs.**  Identify specific processes or functions that contribute to these anomalies and optimize their resource utilization. 4. **Examine network traffic patterns reflected in 'sum(received_bytes_total) by (method)'**. Identify potential congestion points, optimize network configuration, and consider scaling resources if necessary."
