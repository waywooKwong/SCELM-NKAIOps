	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, sum(duration) by (job)", 
	"reason": "The analysis of the metrics indicates several KPIs are significantly deviating from their expected behavior. Notably, 'message' shows a drastic shift in mean value, suggesting potential communication issues. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit similar trends, hinting at problems with authentication or data retrieval processes. Furthermore,  'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'sum(duration) by (job)' reveal performance bottlenecks, which could be impacting overall system responsiveness.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'message' KPI:** Analyze logs related to communication channels to identify the source of the deviation. 2. **Review Authentication and Authorization:** Examine configurations for 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to ensure proper access control and data retrieval mechanisms. 3. **Optimize Resource Utilization:**  Profile and optimize code sections contributing to 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and 'sum(duration) by (job)' to improve performance."
