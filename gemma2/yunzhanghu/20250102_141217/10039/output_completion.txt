{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,computeOwnObjectIDs end, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,message,sum  ",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis shows several KPIs exhibiting significant deviations from their expected behavior. Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message' and 'sum' demonstrate notable anomalies in their minimum, maximum, or mean values compared to previous periods. This suggests potential underlying issues with data processing, service performance, or resource utilization.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the impacted services:**  Dive deeper into the logs and metrics of the services related to the anomalous KPIs. Identify any error messages, performance bottlenecks, or unusual resource consumption patterns. 2. **Review recent changes:** Analyze recent deployments, configuration updates, or code modifications that might have introduced these issues. 3. **Monitor system resources:** Keep a close eye on CPU usage, memory allocation, network traffic, and disk space to identify any resource constraints contributing to the anomalies. 4. **Scale up resources if needed:** If resource utilization is consistently high, consider scaling up server instances or adjusting resource allocations to accommodate the increased demand. 5. **Implement robust monitoring and alerting:**  Set up comprehensive monitoring systems with alerts for key performance indicators (KPIs) to proactively identify potential issues before they significantly impact users."
