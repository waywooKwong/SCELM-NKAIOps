	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "The top 5 abnormal kpis are: AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[1m])) by (method)",
	"reason": "The analyzed data indicates a significant deviation from expected patterns in several key performance indicators (KPIs).  Specifically, the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI, 'getBackupEmp success' KPI, and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPI show increased negative values post-change, suggesting potential issues with authentication or data retrieval. The 'message' KPI exhibits an unexpected increase in variance, potentially hinting at communication bottlenecks or errors.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and getBackupEmp success KPIs:**  Review logs and trace requests to pinpoint the cause of the negative value spikes. 2. **Examine the computeOwnObjectIDs end KPI:** Analyze the code responsible for object identification to identify potential performance bottlenecks or logic errors. 3. **Analyze message patterns:** Monitor system logs and messaging queues to understand the nature of communication issues affecting the 'message' KPI."
