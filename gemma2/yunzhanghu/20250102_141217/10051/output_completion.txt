	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(request)",
	"reason": "Several KPIs indicate performance degradation and potential issues. 'AuthListByName' shows a significant decrease in mean value, suggesting potential access or authorization problems. 'getBackupEmp success' rate has also dropped, indicating failures in backup operations. 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message' show inconsistent behavior with increased variance. Additionally, the overall KPI 'sum(request)' exhibits an upward trend, possibly indicating high resource utilization.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate access logs for 'AuthListByName' to identify potential authentication failures or authorization issues.** 2. **Review backup logs and system events for 'getBackupEmp success' to pinpoint the cause of backup failures.** 3. **Analyze the performance metrics for 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message' to understand the root causes of inconsistency.** 4. **Monitor resource utilization closely, including CPU, memory, and network traffic, associated with the 'sum(request)' KPI. Consider scaling resources or optimizing code if necessary.**"
