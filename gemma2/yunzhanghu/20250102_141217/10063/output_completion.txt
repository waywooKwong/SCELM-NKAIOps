	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "1. container_memory_rss, 2. approve status error, 3. superiorAndDeputy empty, 4. get <:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> , 5.  parse request body",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges, indicating potential system instability and performance issues. Notably, 'container_memory_rss' shows increased memory consumption, while 'approve status error' highlights a rise in errors within the approval process. The 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI suggests data inconsistencies, potentially impacting workflows. Furthermore, KPIs related to request processing and tracing ('get <:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ', 'parse request body') demonstrate performance bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate memory consumption:** Analyze the 'container_memory_rss' data to identify processes consuming excessive resources. Consider optimizing resource allocation, code efficiency, or scaling infrastructure as needed. 2. **Address approval errors:**  Debug and resolve the root causes of 'approve status error'. This might involve reviewing workflows, input validation, or system configurations. 3. **Ensure data integrity:** Verify the accuracy and completeness of data related to 'superiorAndDeputy empty'. Investigate potential data sources, synchronization issues, or database anomalies. 4. **Optimize request processing:** Profile and optimize the performance of request handling processes, including 'get <:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ' and 'parse request body'. Identify bottlenecks and implement performance enhancements. 5. **Implement monitoring:** Establish comprehensive monitoring for all affected KPIs to proactively detect and address potential issues in real-time."
