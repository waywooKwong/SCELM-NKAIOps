	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(duration) by (method)",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from the expected patterns. Several KPIs, including 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'sum(duration) by (method)' show increased anomalies after the change.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. It's recommended to:\n* Analyze the logs and error messages associated with the affected KPIs.\n* Review any recent code changes or configuration updates that might have impacted these metrics.\n* Monitor the system performance and resource utilization closely.\n* Consider rolling back the change if it's deemed to be the primary cause of the anomalies."
