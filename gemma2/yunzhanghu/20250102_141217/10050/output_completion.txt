	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) are exhibiting anomalous behavior after the change. Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message' and  'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show significant deviations from their historical trends, indicating potential issues with data retrieval, authentication, or processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the logs for the affected services:** This will help pinpoint the exact source of the anomalies. 2. **Review recent code changes:** Identify any modifications that might have introduced bugs or impacted the performance of these KPIs. 3. **Monitor resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to rule out resource constraints as a cause. 4. **Test the affected functionalities:** Perform thorough testing to reproduce the anomalies and gather more detailed information about the issues. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up proactive monitoring for these KPIs to detect similar issues in the future."
