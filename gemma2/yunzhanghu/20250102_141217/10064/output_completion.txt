	"reason": "The metrics data shows significant deviations from normal patterns. Several KPIs, including 'superiorAndDeputy empty', 'container_memory_rss', and 'approve status error',  exhibit unusual spikes and drops outside expected ranges. This suggests potential issues with resource consumption, workflow performance, or system stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource usage**: Analyze the 'container_memory_rss' KPI to identify containers consuming excessive memory. Consider scaling down resources, optimizing application code, or reviewing container configurations.\n2. **Troubleshoot workflow bottlenecks**: Examine the 'approve status error' KPI for patterns and potential causes. Identify and address any bottlenecks in the approval process that could lead to errors.\n3. **Monitor system logs**: Review logs related to the 'superiorAndDeputy empty' KPI for clues about the cause of the issue.  This might help pinpoint configuration problems or application logic errors.\n4. **Implement performance monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring for key KPIs and systems to proactively identify potential issues before they become critical.
