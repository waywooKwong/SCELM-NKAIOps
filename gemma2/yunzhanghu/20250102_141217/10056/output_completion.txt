	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,  message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,   computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes after the update.  'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' shifted to a more positive trend which is unusual. 'message'  also shows an abnormal upward shift in mean value. Additionally, several KPIs like 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', now consistently report zero values.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this update to pinpoint the source of these anomalies. Analyze the logs and system metrics around the time of the change for further insights. Consider rolling back the recent updates or reverting specific code changes if necessary."
