	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "irate(build_seconds[1m]) > 30, irate(loadRegoMySQLInterval_success_rate[1m]) < 80, sum(approve_status_error[1m]) > 5,  sum(superiorAndDeputy_empty[1m]) > 10, sum(build_duration_seconds[1m]) > 60",
	"reason": "The analyzed metrics indicate a significant performance degradation in the system. Key indicators such as build duration and loadRegoMySQLInterval success rate show alarming deviations from expected values. Furthermore, an increase in errors like approve_status_error and superiorAndDeputy_empty suggests potential issues within specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource bottlenecks**: Analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage during build processes to identify potential bottlenecks. 2. **Optimize RegoMySQLInterval**: Review the configuration of loadRegoMySQLInterval and optimize database queries for efficiency. 3. **Address approve_status_error**: Debug the code responsible for 'approve_status' to identify and resolve the root cause of errors. 4. **Examine superiorAndDeputy logic**:  Thoroughly review the logic within 'superiorAndDeputy' to pinpoint the reasons behind the increased empty occurrences."
