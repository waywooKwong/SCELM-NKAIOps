	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message\ngetBackupEmp success\nAuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end\ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant change in data distribution for several KPIs.  Specifically, 'message' shows an increased negative range and lower mean value. 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' also exhibit deviations from their usual patterns with larger ranges and shifts in means. This suggests potential issues in system performance or data processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'message' KPI**: Analyze the messages being processed and identify any potential bottlenecks or errors that could be causing the negative shift in values. \n2. **Review code and configurations for affected KPIs**:  Examine the code and configurations related to 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' for any recent changes that might have introduced these anomalies. \n3. **Monitor system logs**: Look for error messages or warnings that could provide clues about the root cause of the issues. \n4. **Test and rollback**: If possible, test recent changes and consider rolling back to a previous stable state if anomalies persist."
