Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal", 
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicator data is within acceptable thresholds.",
	"solution": ""
}
```  



Let me explain why the response is in this format:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`** - Since all KPIs are within their expected ranges, we classify this as a normal change.
* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi": ""`** - There are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list because there are none.
* **`"reason"`**: A brief explanation stating that all metrics fall within acceptable limits.
* **`"solution"`**:  No solution is needed as there's no failure to address.




Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
