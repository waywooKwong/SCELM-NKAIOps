	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success\nauthenticate user \ngetBackupEmp success\nAuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations from normal behavior. Several KPIs, including 'getBackupEmp success', 'authenticate user', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end',  exhibit unusual spikes or drops, indicating potential issues with authentication, data retrieval, or system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI:** Analyze logs and trace requests to identify any errors or bottlenecks during backup operations. 2. **Review authentication processes:** Examine user access logs and security configurations to rule out compromised accounts or authorization issues. 3. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify any resource constraints affecting performance. 4. **Consider rolling back recent changes:** If the anomalies emerged after a recent deployment, reverting to a previous stable state might help isolate the problem."
