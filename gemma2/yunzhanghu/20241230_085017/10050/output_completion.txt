	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The analyzed data shows that several KPIs have deviated significantly from their expected ranges. This indicates potential issues within the system. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'message'  exhibit significant drops or spikes in performance, suggesting problems with authentication, data retrieval, or communication.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. It is recommended to: \n1. Examine logs for error messages related to the affected KPIs.\n2. Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory) during periods of abnormal behavior.\n3. Review recent configuration changes that may have impacted system performance.\n4. Consider implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively identify and address similar issues in the future."
