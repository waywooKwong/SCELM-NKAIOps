	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from the expected patterns. Several KPIs, including `superiorAndDeputy empty`, `container_memory_rss`, and `approve status error`, exhibit abnormal fluctuations. This suggests potential issues with resource consumption, service performance, or data processing.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of the anomalies in the identified KPIs. Analyze logs, monitor system resources, and review code for potential bottlenecks or errors. Address any identified issues to restore normal operation."
