	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a decrease in mean and maximum values, indicating potential issues with authentication or data retrieval. 'getBackupEmp success' also shows a decrease in mean, suggesting problems with backup processes.  'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show negative trends and fluctuations which may point to errors in message handling or object retrieval. These anomalies collectively suggest underlying system instability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the logs and error reports associated with 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' to pinpoint the root cause of their performance degradation.  Review the messages and object operations related to 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' for clues about the nature of the errors. Consider implementing monitoring tools to track these KPIs in real-time and trigger alerts when deviations occur, enabling quicker issue identification and resolution."
