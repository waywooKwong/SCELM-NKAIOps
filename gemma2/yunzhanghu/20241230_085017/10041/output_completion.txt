	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant number of anomalies (620) and 38 anomalous KPIs. This suggests a system-wide issue rather than isolated problems.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the anomalies:** Analyze the logs, metrics, and error messages associated with the anomalous KPIs to identify common patterns or contributing factors.\n2. **Review recent changes:** Check for any recent code deployments, infrastructure updates, or configuration modifications that might have introduced these issues.\n3. **Monitor system resources:** Ensure that the system has adequate CPU, memory, and network resources to handle the current workload.\n4. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and respond to anomalies in real-time.\n5. **Rollback recent changes:** If possible, consider rolling back any recent changes that might be causing the problems."
