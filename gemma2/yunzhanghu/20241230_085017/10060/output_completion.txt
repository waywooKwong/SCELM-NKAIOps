	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show abnormal fluctuations and potential issues.\n\n* **`no need or no have tags [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>]`**:  This suggests a lack of proper instrumentation or tracing, potentially hindering debugging and performance analysis.\n * **`Depts only have yunzhanghu`**: This KPI might indicate a dependency issue or an incomplete configuration.\n* **`gin`**:  The fluctuations in this KPI could point to underlying resource contention or inefficiencies in the Gin framework itself.\n\nOther KPIs like `sum(irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{...}))`,  and `approve_rate` are also showing concerning trends, potentially indicating performance bottlenecks or approval process delays.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate and address tracing issues**: Ensure proper instrumentation is in place to capture relevant trace data for debugging and performance analysis.\n2. **Review dependency configurations**: Analyze the `Depts only have yunzhanghu` KPI to identify potential dependencies that are not properly configured or causing conflicts.\n3. **Optimize Gin framework performance**: Look into resource utilization patterns, potential bottlenecks within the Gin framework, and optimize its configuration for better efficiency.\n4. **Monitor and address CPU usage**: Analyze the trends in `sum(irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{...}))` to identify resource-intensive processes and implement optimizations or scaling strategies.\n5. **Streamline approval processes**: Investigate potential delays within the `approve_rate` KPI and explore ways to optimize the approval process for faster turnaround times."
