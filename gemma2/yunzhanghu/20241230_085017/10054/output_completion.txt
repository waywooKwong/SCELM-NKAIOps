{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, sum(duration),  sum(latency), computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant drop in performance and an increase in errors after the change. Several KPIs, including 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success', have shown anomalies with negative trends, suggesting potential issues with authentication and data retrieval processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made to the system and focus on reviewing the code related to authentication and data access. Analyze logs and error messages for clues about the root cause of the performance degradation and errors. Consider reverting the recent changes or implementing a rollback strategy if possible."
