	"reason": "The data analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This indicates potential issues with system stability or resource utilization. Notably, KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show a trend towards increased negative values, suggesting potential failures in backup operations, authorization list retrieval, and object identification processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'.** This could involve reviewing logs, tracing execution paths, and analyzing resource usage patterns during these operations. 2. **Monitor system resources closely**, particularly CPU and memory utilization, to identify potential bottlenecks or performance degradation. 3. **Consider rolling back the recent changes** if they appear to be directly responsible for the observed anomalies.  4. **Test thoroughly before deploying any further changes** to minimize the risk of introducing new issues."
