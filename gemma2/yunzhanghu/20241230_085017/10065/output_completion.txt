	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected ranges.  Specifically, 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' indicates a potential issue with database performance, while 'approve status error' and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' suggest problems within the approval workflow. Additionally, 'build <:*:> [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> '  and 'irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{instance=\"*\"})' show increased resource usage which could be contributing to the overall performance degradation.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate and optimize the database queries used by 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success'.** This may involve indexing, query tuning, or reviewing schema design. \n2. **Analyze the logs and trace data for 'approve status error' and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' to pinpoint the specific bottlenecks in the approval workflow.**  This could help identify areas for process improvement or bug fixes. \n3. **Monitor system resources closely, particularly CPU usage, and implement load balancing or scaling strategies if necessary.** This will help ensure that your infrastructure can handle the increased demand."
