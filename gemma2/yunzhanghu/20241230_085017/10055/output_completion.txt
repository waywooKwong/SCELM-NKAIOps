	"reason": "The metrics analysis indicates significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show a sharp increase or decrease in values compared to their baseline trends. Additionally, 'message' and 'computeDeptObjectIDs end' exhibit unusual fluctuations.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies.  It's recommended to: \n1. **Review recent changes** made to the system, focusing on those related to the affected KPIs.\n2. **Analyze logs and error messages** for any relevant clues about potential issues during the change implementation.\n3. **Monitor the affected systems** closely for ongoing performance degradation or unexpected behavior.\n4. **Consider reverting the recent changes** if their impact appears detrimental, while troubleshooting continues."
