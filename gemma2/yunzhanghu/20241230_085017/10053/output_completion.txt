	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in performance and potential anomalies. Key KPIs like AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,  sum(duration) by (pod), sum(requests) by (pod), message, and computeOwnObjectIDs end show increased variability or unusual trends, suggesting underlying issues.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This may involve:\n* Analyzing logs for errors or warnings related to these KPIs.\n* Monitoring system resources like CPU, memory, and network traffic to identify bottlenecks.\n* Reviewing recent code changes or configuration updates that might have introduced issues.\n* Consulting with development or operations teams to gather insights and expertise."
