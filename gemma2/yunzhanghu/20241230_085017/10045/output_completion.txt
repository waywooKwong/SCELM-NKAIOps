	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method)",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate several key performance indicators have significantly deviated from their expected ranges.  Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show a downward trend in performance. Simultaneously, 'message' exhibits an upward trend, suggesting increased communication activity which might be a symptom of underlying issues. Additionally, the rate of HTTP requests has spiked, indicating potential system overload or contention.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' by examining logs, resource utilization and code execution time. 2. Analyze the increased communication activity in 'message' to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in data flow. 3. Monitor the rate of HTTP requests closely and explore strategies to optimize application performance and reduce resource consumption. 4. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and respond to future performance anomalies."
