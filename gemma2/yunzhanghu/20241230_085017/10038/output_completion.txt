	"reason": "The metrics show several KPIs with significant deviations from their expected behavior, indicating potential issues. Notably, 'message' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibit unusual trends, while 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' also display anomalies. This suggests underlying problems in those specific functions or systems.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of these anomalies by analyzing logs, tracing execution flows, and reviewing recent code changes. Focus on the top 5 abnormal KPIs mentioned to pinpoint the source of the issues. Consider implementing monitoring solutions to track these KPIs more closely and detect future deviations promptly."
