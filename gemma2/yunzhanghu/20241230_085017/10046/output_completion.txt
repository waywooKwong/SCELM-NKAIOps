	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method)",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) post-change. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and  'sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method)' exhibit substantial changes in their distribution, suggesting potential issues with the implemented changes. ",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Focus on areas impacting 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' KPIs. 2. **Debug affected components:** Step through code execution paths to pinpoint the source of anomalies in these KPIs. 3. **Monitor resource utilization:** Analyze CPU, memory, and network usage during periods when abnormal behavior occurs. 4. **Revert recent changes (if possible):** If pinpointing the problematic change is difficult, temporarily revert changes to isolate the issue. 5. **Implement logging and monitoring:** Enhance logging around affected areas and set up proactive monitoring for these KPIs."
