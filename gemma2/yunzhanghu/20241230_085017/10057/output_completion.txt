	"reason": "The data shows significant deviations from expected patterns for several KPIs, indicating potential issues within the system. Specifically, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit unexpected changes in their ranges, suggesting problems with authentication or backup processes. 'message' KPI shows narrowing range, which may indicate reduced message volume or communication issues. The sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="jiesuan-service"}[5m])) and sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="jiesuan-api"}[5m])) KPIs show potential performance bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of anomalies in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' KPIs. This may involve reviewing logs, monitoring system resources, and checking for recent configuration changes. 2. Analyze the reduced range of 'message' KPI to identify potential causes such as decreased user activity or communication disruptions. 3. Optimize resource allocation and infrastructure capacity to address potential performance bottlenecks indicated by the HTTP request rate metrics."
