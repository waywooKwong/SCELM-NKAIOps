	"reason": "Several KPIs indicate performance degradation and potential resource issues. 'container_memory_rss' suggests memory consumption is high, while 'approve status error' points to potential bottlenecks in the approval process. 'superiorAndDeputy empty' might signal a problem with role assignments or data integrity. Additionally, the presence of multiple 'build' anomalies suggests build processes are unstable.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate memory consumption:** Analyze 'container_memory_rss' trends and identify resource-intensive processes. Consider optimizing code, utilizing caching, or scaling resources. \n2. **Troubleshoot approval process:** Examine the cause of 'approve status error'. This could involve reviewing workflows, database queries, or communication between systems.\n3. **Address role assignment issues:** Verify the accuracy and completeness of 'superiorAndDeputy' data. Correct any inconsistencies and ensure proper role assignments.\n4. **Stabilize build processes:** Analyze the 'build' anomalies to identify common patterns or errors. Implement robust logging, monitoring, and automated testing to improve build reliability."
