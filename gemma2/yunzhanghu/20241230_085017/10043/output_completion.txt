	"reason": "The analyzed KPI data reveals several anomalies. The metrics like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message' show significant deviations from the expected behavior, indicating potential issues in system performance and functionality. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of these anomalies by examining logs, tracing requests, and analyzing resource utilization for affected components. Consider implementing monitoring solutions to track these KPIs more closely and proactively identify future issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type**:  Set to "failure" because there are clear deviations from expected behavior in multiple KPIs.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: Highlights the most concerning KPIs, excluding those named 'build' as requested.
* **reason**: Provides a concise explanation based on the observed anomalies in the data.
* **solution**: Offers general guidance to address the identified issues.
