	"reason": "The metrics data indicates significant deviations from normal patterns. Several KPIs, such as getBackupEmp success ,computeOwnObjectIDs end , AuthListByName  <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  exhibit abnormal trends with large fluctuations and values outside expected ranges.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies by examining system logs, monitoring tools, and relevant code. Identify any recent changes or events that might have triggered these deviations. Consider troubleshooting steps such as reviewing configurations, resource utilization, and network connectivity. Implement appropriate solutions to address the identified issues and restore normal operating conditions."
