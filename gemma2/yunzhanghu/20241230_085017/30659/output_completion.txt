Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "There are no top 5 abnormal KPIs.",
	"reason": "All KPI data is within acceptable thresholds, indicating normal system operation.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


Let me know if you'd like to explore how this analysis would change if some KPIs were outside their expected ranges.
