	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change. 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drops to a fixed value of 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' show altered ranges and trends, suggesting potential problems in object ID management and backup operations. 'message' shows a change in trend to upward, which might indicate a rise in error messages or unexpected communication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drop. Review logs and system configurations related to policy loading. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' to identify potential issues with object ID management and backup processes. Monitor the 'message' KPI for any specific error patterns and address them accordingly."
