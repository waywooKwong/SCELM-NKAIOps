	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly decreased after the change, indicating a potential performance degradation.  Specifically, KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' show a drastic drop in values, suggesting a decline in request processing.  'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' also exhibit negative changes, pointing to potential issues with service calls and data retrieval. 'get metadata from header' and 'ClientEnvHandler is <:*:>' demonstrate similar trends, further reinforcing the concern about performance impact.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to identify the root cause of the performance degradation. Analyze the logs and monitoring data for the affected KPIs to pinpoint specific bottlenecks. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigating strategies to restore the previous performance levels."
