	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'  went from wide ranges to a very narrow range of 0, suggesting a potential issue with data collection or processing. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu'  shows an increase in its maximum value, indicating a possible shift in the data distribution. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' also had their ranges reduced to 0,  pointing towards potential problems with these specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes in data collection and processing pipelines for KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'. Analyze the reasons behind the increased maximum value in 'Depts only have yunzhanghu'.  Review the logs and configurations related to 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' to identify and resolve any issues causing the data range reduction to 0."
