	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shifted significantly after the change.  KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a decrease in their minimum values and an increase in their maximum values, indicating potential issues with resource allocation or processing capacity. Similarly, KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' exhibit significant changes in their ranges, suggesting potential bottlenecks or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This could involve analyzing logs, monitoring system resource utilization, and reviewing the code changes introduced.  Possible solutions might include: \n\n* Adjusting resource allocation for affected services.\n* Optimizing code to improve performance.\n* Investigating potential bottlenecks in the system architecture.\n* Reversing the recent changes if they are identified as the primary cause of the anomalies."
