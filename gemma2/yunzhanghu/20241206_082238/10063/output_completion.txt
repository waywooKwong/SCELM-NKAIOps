{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "receive_bytes_total, getPermTagsAndValues, parseDataReportFlag, container_memory_rss, approve status error",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in several key performance indicators after the change.  This includes a decrease in receive_bytes_total, indicating potential network issues.  getPermTagsAndValues and parseDataReportFlag show increased variability, suggesting problems with data processing. container_memory_rss indicates memory pressure, and approve status error suggests workflow disruptions.",
	"solution": "Investigate the network infrastructure for bottlenecks or connectivity problems. Analyze the logs for getPermTagsAndValues and parseDataReportFlag to identify the root cause of the increased variability. Optimize memory usage by identifying and removing unnecessary resource consumption. Review the workflow for approve status error and address any potential bottlenecks or configuration issues."
