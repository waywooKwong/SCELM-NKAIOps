	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a drastic reduction in minimum values and a narrowing of the range, suggesting potential data loss or filtering issues. Similarly, 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit a similar trend, indicating potential problems with data retrieval or processing. The 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total...))' KPI also shows a change in range, potentially indicating network performance issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the exact cause of these shifts. Review logs and monitor system resources for any anomalies that might correlate with the changes. Consider reverting the changes or implementing temporary workarounds while investigating the root cause. Ensure proper data handling and validation mechanisms are in place to prevent data loss or corruption."
