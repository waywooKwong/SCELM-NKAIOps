	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_network_receive_bytes_total, getPermTagsAndValues, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty, container_memory_rss",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly changed after the update.  KPIs like `container_network_receive_bytes_total`, `getPermTagsAndValues`, `loadRegoMySQLInterval success`, `superiorAndDeputy empty`, and `container_memory_rss` show  increased variance and shifted means, indicating potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced in the update to identify potential causes for the KPI fluctuations. 2. **Monitor resource usage:** Track CPU, memory, and network usage to pinpoint any resource bottlenecks or contention issues. 3. **Analyze logs:** Examine system and application logs for any error messages or warnings that might shed light on the problem. 4. **Revert the changes:** If the issue persists, consider reverting the recent changes and testing the system again to isolate the problematic code. 5. **Test thoroughly:**  Implement comprehensive testing procedures to ensure that future updates do not introduce similar issues."
