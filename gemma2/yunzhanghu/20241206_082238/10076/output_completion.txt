	"reason": "The data ranges of several key KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues.  KPIs like 'superiorAndDeputy empty', '<:REQ:>', 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>', 'svc.ApproveCallback failed', and '<:list modules:>' show drastic changes in their minimum and maximum values, suggesting a disruption in normal operations. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the exact cause of these shifts. Review logs and monitor system performance for any anomalies that correlate with the time of the change.  Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigating strategies until the root cause is identified and resolved."
