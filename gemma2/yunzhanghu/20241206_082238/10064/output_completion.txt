	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getPermTagsAndValues, container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty, approve status error",
	"reason": "The provided data shows significant changes in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'getPermTagsAndValues', 'container_cpu_usage_seconds_total', and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' exhibit widened ranges and shifts in mean values, indicating potential performance degradation.  'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' also show anomalies, suggesting issues with specific functionalities. These changes collectively point towards a failure.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies in each affected KPI. This might involve reviewing logs, monitoring system resources, and analyzing the code changes introduced. For example, for 'container_cpu_usage_seconds_total', check if there are resource contention issues or inefficient code execution. For 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', examine the database performance and connection settings. Address the identified issues to restore the system's stability and performance."
