	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drops to a constant 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit reduced ranges, suggesting potential issues with object retrieval, department management, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue. Review policy loading mechanisms and configurations. Analyze logs and error messages related to 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' for further insights. Consider deploying monitoring tools to track these KPIs in real-time and identify potential performance bottlenecks."
