	"reason": "While there are anomalies detected, the changes in metric ranges and trends don't necessarily point to a significant failure. Some KPIs show improvements (e.g., build <:*:>).  The anomalies might be due to various factors like data fluctuations or minor adjustments in the system. Further investigation is needed to determine if these anomalies are truly problematic.",

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "normal"** -  The provided data doesn't clearly indicate a catastrophic failure. Some KPIs show positive changes, and the anomalies might be within acceptable limits or due to temporary fluctuations.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  I've selected KPIs with significant changes in range and/or trend that are not related to "build" as requested.

* **reason:** The explanation emphasizes the lack of clear evidence of a major failure. It suggests that further analysis is required to understand the significance of the anomalies.

* **solution:** Since the situation doesn't appear to be a critical failure, a solution is not immediately necessary. 



Let me know if you'd like to explore specific KPIs in more detail or have any further questions!
