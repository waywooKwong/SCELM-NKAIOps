	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has a range of [0.0,0.0] after the change, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show changes in their ranges, suggesting potential issues with object retrieval, department management, and authentication.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' change and ensure policies are being loaded correctly. 2. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify the root cause of the deviations and implement necessary fixes."
