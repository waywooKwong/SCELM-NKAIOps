	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The data shows a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' have drastically reduced their ranges, indicating potential issues with data loading or processing.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu' shows a narrowing range, suggesting potential changes in department structure or user access.  'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' also show reduced ranges, implying potential problems with data retrieval or backup processes. These changes collectively point to a potential failure scenario.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the data range reductions in the affected KPIs.  Review recent code changes, database configurations, and system logs to pinpoint the source of the issue.  Consider rolling back the recent change if it is identified as the primary cause.  Additionally, monitor these KPIs closely and implement corrective actions to restore normal performance levels."
