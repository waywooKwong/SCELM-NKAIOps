	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>','computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show notable decreases in minimum values and increases in maximum values, suggesting unexpected behavior or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to identify the root cause of these shifts.  Analyze logs and system resources to pinpoint the affected components. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigation strategies to restore the KPIs to their expected ranges."
