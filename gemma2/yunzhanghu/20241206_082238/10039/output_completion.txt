{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues. For example, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, suggesting a problem with policy loading. Similarly, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message' exhibit altered trends and ranges, pointing to potential functionality problems.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to policy loading and the affected KPIs. Analyze the logs and error messages for clues about the root cause of the data range shifts. Consider reverting the recent changes or implementing fixes to address the identified issues."
