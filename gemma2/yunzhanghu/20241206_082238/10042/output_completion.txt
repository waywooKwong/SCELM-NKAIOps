	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly shifted after the change.  KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a drastic decrease in minimum values and an increase in maximum values, indicating potential issues with policy loading and object retrieval.  Similarly, 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show changes in both minimum and maximum values, suggesting disruptions in department management, backup processes, and authentication. These combined shifts point towards a system-wide impact caused by the change.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:**  Review the code changes made after the deployment to identify the specific modifications that might be causing these issues. 2. **Monitor logs:** Examine system logs for any error messages or warnings related to policy loading, object retrieval, department management, backup processes, and authentication. 3. **Rollback the change:** If possible, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the system to its previous state and identify the root cause of the anomalies. 4. **Test thoroughly:** Once the issue is resolved, conduct thorough testing to ensure that the system is functioning correctly and that the changes have not introduced any new problems."
