	"reason": "The data ranges of many KPIs have significantly shrunk after the change, indicating a potential decrease in system activity or responsiveness. Some KPIs, like 'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>', show a shift in trend from up to down, suggesting a potential regression in error handling or functionality.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to understand their impact on system behavior. Analyze the logs and error messages related to the affected KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the issues. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigating measures to restore the desired system performance."
