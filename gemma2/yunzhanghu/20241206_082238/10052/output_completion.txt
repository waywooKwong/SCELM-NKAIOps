	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in data ranges, particularly for KPIs related to system performance and resource utilization. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' exhibit drastic reductions in their minimum values, indicating potential issues with policy loading and object retrieval. Similarly, KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' show altered trends, suggesting problems with department management and backup operations. The 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' KPI, which tracks network receive bytes, also shows a significant decrease in its range, indicating potential network congestion or issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these changes by analyzing logs, monitoring system resources, and examining relevant configurations.  Focus on the following areas:\n\n* **Policy Loading:** Troubleshoot 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' to ensure policies are being loaded correctly and efficiently.\n* **Object Retrieval:** Analyze 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' to identify bottlenecks or errors in object retrieval operations.\n* **Department Management:** Review 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to understand the impact of potential issues with department configuration or data.\n* **Backup Operations:** Investigate 'getBackupEmp success' to ensure backups are successful and data integrity is maintained.\n* **Network Performance:** Monitor network traffic and resources closely to identify potential congestion or connectivity problems related to 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8'.\n\nImplement necessary fixes and monitor the system closely to ensure stability and performance."
