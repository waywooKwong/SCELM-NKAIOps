	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in performance after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' which dropped to 0, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' which reversed trend, and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' which showed a less negative mean, suggest a potential issue with policy loading, object ID retrieval, and department data handling. Additionally, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also experienced unusual changes, indicating potential problems with authentication and data retrieval processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made and their impact on the affected systems. Analyze logs and system metrics to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing corrective measures to restore normal functionality. Further testing and monitoring are necessary to ensure stability and performance after addressing the issues."
