	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' now consistently shows 0, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit decreased minimum values and altered trends, implying potential errors in data retrieval or processing. 'message' shows a reversed trend, indicating potential communication issues.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' consistently showing 0. 2. Analyze the logs and error messages for 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' to pinpoint the source of the data retrieval or processing errors. 3. Examine the communication logs and system configurations related to 'message' to identify and resolve the reversed trend."
