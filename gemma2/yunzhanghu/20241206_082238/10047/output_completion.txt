	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drops to a constant 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' all show shifts in their ranges and trends, suggesting potential disruptions in object retrieval, department management, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue. Review logs and system configurations related to policy loading and deployment. Analyze the changes in the ranges and trends of the other affected KPIs to identify potential dependencies or cascading effects. Consider reverting the change if it is determined to be the primary cause of the anomalies."
