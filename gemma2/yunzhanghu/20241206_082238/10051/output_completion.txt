	"reason": "There are significant changes in the data ranges and trends of several KPIs after the change. For example, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range and mean, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. Similarly, KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit shifts in their ranges and trends, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval, department management, backup operations, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these changes. This could involve examining logs, monitoring system resources, and analyzing the code changes implemented during the change. Once the root cause is identified, appropriate solutions can be implemented to address the issues."
