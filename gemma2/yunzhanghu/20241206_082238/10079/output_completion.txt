	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the update, indicating potential issues.  Specifically, KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a decrease in their range, suggesting a possible reduction in requests or module activity. Conversely, KPIs like 'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' show a narrowing range, indicating potential issues with error handling or specific operations. The 'get metadata from header' KPI also shows a change in range, suggesting potential issues with metadata retrieval.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes in 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>'**: Analyze the code changes related to these KPIs to understand why the request volume or module activity might have decreased. 2. **Review the error handling logic for 'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>'**: Identify potential issues in the code that might be causing the narrowing range of these KPIs. 3. **Examine the metadata retrieval process for 'get metadata from header'**: Investigate any changes in the code or data structure that might be affecting metadata retrieval."
