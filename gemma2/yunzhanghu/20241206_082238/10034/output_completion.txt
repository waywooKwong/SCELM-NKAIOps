	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly shifted after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to a range of [0.0,0.0], indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' also show  increased variance and shifted means, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval, department management, and message processing.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue ('loaded policy count:<:NUM:>') and address it.  Review logs and monitoring data for the affected KPIs to pinpoint the source of the problems.  Consider rolling back the change if it is causing significant negative impacts."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the provided data clearly indicates a negative impact on several key performance indicators after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  I've chosen KPIs with the most drastic changes and those directly related to core system functions (policy loading, object retrieval, department management, and message processing).  I excluded "build" KPIs as requested.
* **reason:**  The explanation highlights the specific changes observed in the data ranges and their potential implications for system functionality.
* **solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the policy loading issue and conducting a thorough investigation of the affected KPIs. It also suggests rolling back the change if necessary.
