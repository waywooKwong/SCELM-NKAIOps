	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in the distribution of several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'message' exhibit a drastic reduction in their maximum values and a shift towards negative values, indicating potential issues with policy loading and communication. Similarly, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show increased variance and a downward trend, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval and department management. These anomalies collectively point towards a system-wide failure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate policy loading issues:** Analyze the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI to identify the specific policies failing to load and investigate the underlying causes. 2. **Review object retrieval processes:** Examine the 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPIs to pinpoint bottlenecks or errors in object retrieval and department management processes. 3. **Analyze communication logs:** Investigate the 'message' KPI to identify any communication errors or failures that could be contributing to the observed anomalies. 4. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU, memory, and network utilization to identify any resource constraints that may be impacting system performance. 5. **Roll back the recent change:** If the anomalies are directly attributable to the recent change, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous system state."
