	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' now consistently shows 0.0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. Other KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit substantial changes in their ranges, suggesting potential disruptions in their respective functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:** Analyze the policy loading process and identify the cause for the constant 0.0 value. This might involve reviewing logs, configurations, and dependencies. 2. **Monitor and analyze the affected KPIs:** Continuously track the performance of 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify patterns and potential root causes. 3. **Rollback the recent changes:** If the analysis points to the recent change as the primary cause, consider reverting it to the previous state and re-evaluate the situation. 4. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms for these KPIs to proactively detect future anomalies and facilitate timely intervention."
