	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show drastic reductions in their ranges, suggesting potential issues with policy loading and object retrieval.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit negative trends, pointing to problems in department management, backup operations, and authentication processes. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate policy loading issues**: Analyze the logs and system resources related to policy loading to identify bottlenecks or errors. 2. **Review object retrieval performance**:  Examine the code and database queries responsible for object retrieval to optimize performance. 3. **Address department management concerns**:  Investigate the 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' issue to understand if there are any configuration or access control problems. 4. **Troubleshoot backup failures**:  Check the backup logs and system status to pinpoint the cause of 'getBackupEmp success' failures. 5. **Review authentication processes**: Analyze the authentication logs and user behavior to identify any security vulnerabilities or performance issues affecting 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'."
