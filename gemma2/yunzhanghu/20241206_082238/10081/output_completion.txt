	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a drastic decrease in their range, suggesting a potential issue with request processing or module functionality. 'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' exhibit a narrowing range, indicating potential errors or failures in specific operations. 'get metadata from header' shows a similar trend, hinting at potential issues with data retrieval. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code changes implemented to pinpoint the source of the issue. 2. **Monitor logs:** Analyze system and application logs for error messages or unusual activity around the time of the change. 3. **Check resource utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to identify any resource bottlenecks. 4. **Test and debug:** Perform thorough testing and debugging to isolate the specific problem areas. 5. **Roll back changes:** If the issue is severe, consider rolling back the changes to the previous stable state."
