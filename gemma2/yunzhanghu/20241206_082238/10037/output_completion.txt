	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a decrease in minimum values and an increase in maximum values, indicating potential issues with data processing or retrieval.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show changes in their data ranges, suggesting potential impacts on related functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the exact cause of these shifts. Review logs and monitor system performance for any bottlenecks or errors that might be contributing to the anomalies. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigating measures to restore the KPIs to their expected ranges."
