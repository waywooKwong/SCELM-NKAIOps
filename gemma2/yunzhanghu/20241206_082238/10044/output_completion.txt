	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to a constant 0, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' all show a shift in their ranges and trends, implying changes in object retrieval, department membership, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue. Analyze the changes in the other KPIs to pinpoint the specific impact areas. Review logs and system configurations to identify potential errors or misconfigurations introduced by the change."
