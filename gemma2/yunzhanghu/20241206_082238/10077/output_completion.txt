	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "approve status error, sum(increase(std_grpc_server_handled_total{job=\"be/yid\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\", grpc_code=\"OK\"}[1m])), svc.ApproveCallback failed, <:REQ:>, DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  Metrics like 'approve status error', 'sum(increase(std_grpc_server_handled_total{job=\"be/yid\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\", grpc_code=\"OK\"}[1m]))', 'svc.ApproveCallback failed', '<:REQ:>' and 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>' show negative trends and increased error rates. This suggests that the change may have introduced issues with the approval process, communication with the backend server, or data processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made during the change to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences affecting these KPIs. 2. **Monitor logs:** Analyze logs from the affected systems to pinpoint specific error messages or patterns that might shed light on the root cause. 3. **Test and rollback:** If possible, implement unit tests to isolate the problematic code and conduct regression testing to assess the impact of the change. Consider rolling back the change if the issues are severe and require immediate attention."
