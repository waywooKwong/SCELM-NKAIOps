	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data shows a significant shift in several KPIs after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  dropped to zero, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  also exhibit unusual changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting broader system instability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:**  Identify why policy loading has stopped. This could involve checking policy files, configuration settings, or dependencies. 2. **Analyze the affected KPIs:** Examine logs and system metrics related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the root cause of their anomalies. 3. **Roll back the change:** If possible, temporarily revert the recent changes to assess if the anomalies are directly related. 4. **Monitor system performance:**  Closely track system metrics after any corrective actions to ensure stability is restored."
