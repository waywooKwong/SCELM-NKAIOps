	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction to zero, suggesting a problem with policy loading. KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit changes in their minimum and maximum values, indicating potential performance or functionality problems.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following: \n1. **'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'**:  Determine why policy loading has stopped. Check for errors in configuration or policy files.\n2. **'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**: Analyze the code and configurations related to these KPIs to identify the root cause of the data range shifts.  Monitor logs and system resources for clues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the data shifts suggest problems.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  I've chosen KPIs that show the most drastic changes and are not named "build". 
* **reason:** The explanation points out the specific changes in data ranges and suggests potential issues based on those changes.
* **solution:**  The solution offers actionable steps to investigate the root causes of the problems identified.
