	"reason": "There are significant changes in several KPIs after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to zero, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show increased ranges, potentially indicating performance bottlenecks or resource contention. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8'  also exhibit changes in their ranges, suggesting potential issues with backup operations and network traffic.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' drop to zero. 2. Analyze the increased ranges in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to identify potential performance bottlenecks or resource contention. 3.  Examine the changes in 'getBackupEmp success' and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' to pinpoint any issues with backup operations and network traffic. 4. Review the recent changes made to the system to identify the potential root cause of these anomalies."
