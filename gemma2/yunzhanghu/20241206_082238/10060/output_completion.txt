	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "approve status error, irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",container=\"\",namespace=~\"jiesuan\",pod=~\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd\",metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"} [1m]) * 100, Response=<:MAP:>, no need or no have tags [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from expected behavior after the change.  'approve status error' indicates a potential issue with the approval process.  'irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total)' suggests increased CPU usage, which could lead to performance bottlenecks. 'Response=<:MAP:>' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu'  indicate potential problems with response times and data consistency.  These anomalies suggest a cascading effect where changes in one area are impacting other critical systems.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'approve status error'**: Analyze the logs and system configurations to identify the root cause of the approval process failures.  2. **Optimize resource utilization**: Monitor CPU usage closely and consider scaling resources, optimizing code, or adjusting container configurations to address the increased CPU load. 3. **Analyze 'Response=<:MAP:>' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu'**:  Examine the code and data pipelines to pinpoint the source of slow response times and potential data inconsistencies. Implement caching, query optimization, and data validation techniques to improve performance and data integrity. 4. **Rollback the recent changes**: If the identified issues are severe, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the system to a stable state. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting**:  Establish robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and respond to anomalies in real-time."
