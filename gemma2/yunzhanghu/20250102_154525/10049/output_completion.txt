	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,computeOwnObjectIDs end, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  sum(duration)",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations from the expected ranges, indicating potential issues with these functionalities.  For example, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' have reduced mean values after the change, suggesting performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This may involve examining logs, tracing requests, and comparing configurations before and after the change. Based on the findings, appropriate solutions can be implemented, such as optimizing code, adjusting resource allocation, or fixing underlying bugs."
