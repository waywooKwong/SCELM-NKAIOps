	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from the normal operational pattern. Several KPIs, including AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, and sum show anomalous behavior with spikes or drops in values compared to previous trends. This suggests potential issues within these components or dependencies.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>**: Examine the ChineseInfo data and related authentication processes for potential bottlenecks or errors. 2. **Analyze getBackupEmp success**: Review backup procedures and logs to identify any failures or performance issues during backups. 3. **Check computeOwnObjectIDs end**:  Investigate object retrieval operations and database interactions for any performance degradation or query issues. 4. **Review message**: Analyze the content and volume of messages passing through critical components for any signs of errors or unexpected patterns. 5. **Monitor sum**: Continuously track the overall system performance and resource utilization to identify potential underlying causes for the anomalies."
