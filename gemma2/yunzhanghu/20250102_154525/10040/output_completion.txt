	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded kpis are: getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(duration) by (job)",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs indicate performance degradation and potential anomalies after the change. This includes increased latency in tasks like 'getBackupEmp success', fluctuations in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and a general shift in the distribution of  'message'.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of performance degradation in 'getBackupEmp success' by analyzing logs and monitoring resource utilization. 2. Examine the fluctuations in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' for potential bottlenecks or unexpected behavior. 3. Analyze the changes in the distribution of 'message' to identify any patterns or spikes that might indicate issues. 4. Roll back the recent change if it is identified as the primary cause of the anomalies. 5. Implement performance tuning strategies based on the identified root causes."
