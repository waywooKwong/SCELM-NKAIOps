	"reason": "Multiple KPIs related to user authentication and data retrieval show significant deviations from their normal ranges. This suggests potential issues with authentication processes, database access, or underlying system performance.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the logs of authentication services and databases for any errors or unusual activity. 2. Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, network) to identify potential bottlenecks. 3. Review recent changes in code or configurations related to authentication and data retrieval processes. 4. Consider implementing performance tuning strategies if resource utilization is high. 5. Engage with system administrators and developers for further analysis and resolution."
