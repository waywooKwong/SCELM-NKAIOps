	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "The top 5 abnormal KPIs are: get_build_time_ms,superiorAndDeputy empty, container_memory_rss, approve status error,  get_approve_status_error_rate ",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from expected behavior. Notably, 'get_build_time_ms' indicates a prolonged build process, while 'superiorAndDeputy empty' suggests potential issues with resource allocation or data retrieval.  The increase in 'container_memory_rss' points to memory pressure, and the rise in 'approve status error' signifies problems with approval workflows.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the extended build times in 'get_build_time_ms'. This may involve analyzing build logs, optimizing build processes, or identifying bottlenecks. 2. Address the issues contributing to 'superiorAndDeputy empty', potentially by reviewing data pipelines, ensuring data availability, and checking for resource constraints. 3. Implement strategies to mitigate memory pressure identified in 'container_memory_rss', such as adjusting container resource limits, optimizing applications for memory efficiency, or scaling infrastructure. 4. Diagnose the 'approve status error' issue by examining approval workflows, logging system configurations, and user permissions. Correct any misconfigurations or implement error handling mechanisms."
