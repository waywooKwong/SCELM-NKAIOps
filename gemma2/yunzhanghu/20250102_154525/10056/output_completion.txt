	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,message,sum(requests),computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in performance metrics for several KPIs. Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success' shows an upward trend in its mean value, while 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' experience a downward trend.  Additionally, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibits a sudden drop to zero. These anomalies suggest potential issues with user authentication, data retrieval processes, or service performance.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the reasons behind the increased success rate of 'getBackupEmp success'. Verify if there are any changes in backup procedures or data volumes that could explain this. 2. Analyze the decrease in mean values for 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' to pinpoint potential bottlenecks or errors in authentication processes or message handling.  3. Examine the sudden drop in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to determine if there are any configuration changes or resource limitations affecting this process. 4. Monitor system logs and error messages for further insights into the root cause of these anomalies."
