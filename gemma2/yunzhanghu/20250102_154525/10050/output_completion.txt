	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected ranges. For example, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit increased negative values, suggesting potential issues with data retrieval or authentication. The 'message' KPI also shows a shift in its distribution, indicating possible communication errors or disruptions.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of these anomalies.  Examine logs and system monitoring data to pinpoint the sources of the deviations in 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' . Review the code responsible for the 'message' KPI to identify potential issues with message processing or transmission. Monitor the performance of the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' function and ensure it's efficiently handling its tasks."
