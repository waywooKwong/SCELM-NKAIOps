	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, sum(duration),  sum(error)",
	"reason": "The analysis of the provided KPI data reveals several anomalies. Multiple KPIs, including 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message', exhibit significant shifts in their metrics post-change. This indicates a potential disruption or malfunction within these components.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**: Examine the Chinese information processing logic to pinpoint the cause of the altered behavior. 2. **Diagnose 'getBackupEmp success'**: Analyze backup processes for errors or resource contention. Review logs and system health checks. 3. **Debug 'message' KPI**: Identify the source of the message changes. Trace back error messages or unusual data patterns. 4. **Review 'sum(duration)' and 'sum(error)'**:  Analyze these KPIs to understand if specific tasks are experiencing performance degradation or increased errors."
