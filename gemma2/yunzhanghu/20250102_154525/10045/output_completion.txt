	"reason": "Multiple KPIs indicate performance degradation or unexpected behavior. These include decreased average values in 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', suggesting potential slowdowns or errors in those processes.  The upward trend in 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' is unusual and might indicate a resource contention issue.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation in 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'. This could involve analyzing logs, system resource usage, and code execution paths.\n2. Address any potential resource contention issues identified with 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' by adjusting resource allocation or optimizing the underlying processes.\n3. Monitor these KPIs closely to track the effectiveness of implemented solutions and identify any recurring problems."
