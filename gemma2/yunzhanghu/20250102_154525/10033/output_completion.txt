	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data for several KPIs indicates a potential issue. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'message' show significant shifts in their mean values and ranges after the change. This suggests underlying problems with authentication, information retrieval, or communication processes.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies.  Examine logs related to authentication, database queries for 'AuthListByName', and message queues for potential errors or bottlenecks. Additionally, monitor system resource utilization to identify any performance degradation that might be contributing to these issues."
