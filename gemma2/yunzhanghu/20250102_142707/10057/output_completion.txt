{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "gin:97, getBackupEmp success:130, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>: :82, sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (route):93, message:84",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from expected behavior.  For example, 'gin:97' and 'getBackupEmp success:130' indicate potential issues with system responsiveness and service performance. Additionally, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>: :82' suggests problems with authentication or authorization logic. These anomalies suggest a broader system instability requiring further investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Analyze Logs:** Investigate logs for errors, warnings, or unusual activity related to the affected KPIs. 2. **Monitor Resource Utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify potential bottlenecks or resource exhaustion. 3. **Review Configuration:** Examine configuration files for missettings or inconsistencies that could contribute to the anomalies. 4. **Test and Debug:** Perform targeted testing and debugging to isolate the root cause of the issues. 5. **Roll Back Changes:** If recent changes were implemented, consider rolling back to a stable state and gradually reintroduce modifications."
