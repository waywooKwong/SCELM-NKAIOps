{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, message, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, sum(requests) ,  computeOwnObjectIDs end ",
	"reason": "The analyzed metrics show several KPIs significantly deviating from their expected ranges. This indicates potential system instability or performance bottlenecks. The 'getBackupEmp success', 'message' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPIs experienced a substantial drop in values, suggesting failures in related operations. The 'sum(requests)' KPI surged, indicating a high load on the system.  The 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPI also showed a significant deviation. These anomalies collectively point towards a system malfunction.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. It is recommended to: \n 1. Analyze logs and error messages for clues about specific failures.\n 2. Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify potential bottlenecks.\n 3. Review recent code changes or configuration updates that might have introduced the issues.\n 4. Scale resources if necessary to handle the increased load.\n 5. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect future anomalies."
