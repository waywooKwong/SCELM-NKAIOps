	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,computeOwnObjectIDs end,message,sum  by (pod,namespace,node)", 
	"reason": "The provided data reveals a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs). Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'sum  by (pod,namespace,node)' demonstrate anomalies with substantial deviations from their expected ranges. This suggests potential issues within the system's backup processes, authentication mechanisms, data retrieval, and overall message handling.",
	"solution": "A thorough investigation is warranted to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This should involve analyzing logs, monitoring system resources, and examining recent code changes.  For instance, if 'getBackupEmp success' shows a decline, review backup schedules and ensure proper execution. For 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' irregularities, scrutinize authentication configurations and user permissions. Addressing these issues will help restore system stability and performance."
