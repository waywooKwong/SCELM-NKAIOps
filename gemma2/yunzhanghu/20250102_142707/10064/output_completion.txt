	"reason": "The metrics show a significant deviation from the expected behavior. Several KPIs, including container_memory_rss, superiorAndDeputy, and approve status error, exhibit anomalies indicating potential resource contention, system errors, or process failures. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Resource Contention:** Analyze the container_memory_rss metric to identify if memory usage is exceeding limits, potentially causing performance degradation. Consider increasing memory allocations or optimizing application code. \n2. **Address System Errors:** Examine the logs and error messages associated with the superiorAndDeputy and approve status error KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the issues.  Implement necessary fixes or workarounds.\n3. **Review Data Access:** Investigate potential problems with data retrieval by analyzing the 'get data from db' KPI. Ensure database connections are stable, queries are optimized, and there are no data integrity issues."
