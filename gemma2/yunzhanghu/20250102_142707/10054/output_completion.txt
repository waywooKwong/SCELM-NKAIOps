{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, sum(value), sum(value), sum(value)",
	"reason": "The data analysis shows significant deviations in several key metrics after the change. Specifically, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibits a sharp decline in mean value and a narrowed range, indicating potential issues with user authentication or authorization processes. 'getBackupEmp success' also shows a reduced mean value, suggesting problems with backup operations. The  'message', 'sum(value)', 'sum(value)' metrics are experiencing unusual spikes or drops, pointing towards unexpected behaviors within the system. ",
	"solution": "Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. 1) Review recent changes related to authentication and authorization systems. 2) Analyze logs and error messages associated with backup operations. 3) Examine the code responsible for 'message' and other affected metrics to identify potential bugs or unexpected inputs."
