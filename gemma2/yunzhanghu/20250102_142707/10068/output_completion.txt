{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "parseDataReportFlag ok,loadRegoMySQLInterval success,superiorAndDeputy empty,approve status error,123",
	"reason": "The data shows that several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly deviated from their expected ranges after the change. These include KPIs related to data parsing, MySQL interval loading, user roles, and approval statuses. This suggests potential issues with the implemented changes affecting core functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes**:  Carefully review the modifications made to pinpoint the exact source of the anomalies in the affected KPIs. 2. **Rollback partially**: If possible, temporarily rollback the changes to the problematic areas and monitor the KPI behavior again. This can help isolate the faulty implementation. 3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging and monitoring systems to capture more detailed information about the processes involved in the affected functionalities. This will aid in identifying the specific points of failure. 4. **Unit Testing**:  Implement comprehensive unit tests for the affected code modules to ensure that future changes do not introduce similar issues."
