	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message,  computeOwnObjectIDs end,  sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (handler)",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a decreasing trend after the change, indicating potential issues with authorization or data retrieval. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'message' exhibit unusual fluctuations, suggesting problems with communication or data processing. 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' and  sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (handler)' show unexpected spikes, possibly due to increased load or resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root causes of these anomalies. Analyze logs, monitor system resources, and review code changes related to affected components. Optimize database queries, enhance error handling mechanisms, and consider scaling infrastructure if necessary."
