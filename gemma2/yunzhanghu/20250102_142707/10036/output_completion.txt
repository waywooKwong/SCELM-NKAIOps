	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "computeOwnObjectIDs end,getBackupEmp success,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,message,sum(request)",
	"reason": "The data analysis shows several key performance indicators (KPIs) have deviated significantly from expected patterns. Specifically, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', and 'sum(request)' exhibit anomalies in their min/max values and means, indicating potential issues with system performance or resource utilization.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This might involve examining logs, monitoring system resource usage (CPU, memory), and analyzing the codebase for potential bottlenecks or bugs. Based on the findings, appropriate solutions could include optimizing database queries, scaling up infrastructure, or addressing faulty code segments."
