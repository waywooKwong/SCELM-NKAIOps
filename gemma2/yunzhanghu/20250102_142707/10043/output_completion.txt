{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  sum(duration) by (pod), sum(requests) by (pod)",
	"reason": "The data shows several KPIs with significantly shifted distributions and increased anomalies after the change. Specifically, 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'message' exhibit larger fluctuations and lower average values, indicating potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the code changes related to 'getBackupEmp', 'AuthListByName', and 'message' for any potential bugs or unintended consequences. 2. Analyze logs and system metrics to identify specific issues contributing to the performance drop. 3. Consider rolling back the recent changes if the identified issues are severe and impacting production systems. 4. Implement monitoring strategies to track these KPIs closely and detect future anomalies promptly."
