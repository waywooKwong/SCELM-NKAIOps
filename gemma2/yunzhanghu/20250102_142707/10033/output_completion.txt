	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Total anomalies found: 584\nTotal number of anomalous kpis: 36\nmessage,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The analysis reveals a significant increase in anomalies post the change.  A total of 584 anomalies were detected, indicating potential issues with data integrity and system stability. The top affected KPIs include 'message', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'getBackupEmp success', suggesting problems in communication, authentication, and potentially database operations.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'message' KPI anomalies:** Analyze error logs and system events to pinpoint the source of communication issues.  \n2. **Review 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' changes:** Scrutinize recent modifications related to authentication logic and data access. Ensure proper authorization checks are in place.\n3. **Examine 'getBackupEmp success' failures:** Investigate database connectivity, backup procedures, and potential data corruption issues.  \n4. **Implement monitoring:** Enhance system monitoring with detailed metrics for these KPIs to proactively detect anomalies in the future. \n5. **Rollback if necessary:** If the changes are recent, consider rolling back to a stable state while investigating the root cause."
