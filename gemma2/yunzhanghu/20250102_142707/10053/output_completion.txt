{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "The top 5 abnormal kpi are: \n1. AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\n2. getBackupEmp success\n3. message \n4. sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total)\n5.  sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes)",
	"reason": "The data indicates several key performance indicators (KPIs) have deviated significantly from expected norms. KPIs such as AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, and message show unusual spikes or drops, suggesting potential issues with authentication, backup processes, or communication channels.  Additionally, container resource utilization metrics like sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total) and sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes) are outside acceptable ranges, pointing to possible resource contention or application bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate authentication issues:** Analyze logs related to AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, focusing on error messages, access attempts, and user activity. Check for configuration mismatches or potential security breaches.\n2. **Review backup procedures:** Examine the execution logs of getBackupEmp success for any errors, warnings, or timeouts. Verify data integrity and ensure backups are successful.\n3. **Analyze message flow:** Inspect logs related to message processing to identify bottlenecks, delays, or failed transmissions. Optimize messaging queues and communication channels.\n4. **Optimize container resource allocation:** Monitor resource usage of containers through tools like Kubernetes' resource quota system. Adjust resource limits and requests based on application needs to prevent contention.\n5.  **Implement load balancing:** Distribute workload across multiple instances of applications to avoid overloading individual servers.
