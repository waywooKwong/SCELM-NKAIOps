	"reason": "The following kpis show anomalies: Depts only have yunzhanghu indicates potential issue with department setup or resource allocation. The 'no need or no have tags' and '<:GIN:>' KPIs suggest potential problems with tracing or logging, which can hinder debugging and performance analysis. The high CPU usage in container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, particularly when exceeding the cpu quota, points to potential resource contention or application inefficiency.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' by reviewing department configurations and resource allocation. 2. Analyze tracing and logging issues indicated by '<:GIN:>' and 'no need or no have tags' KPIs. Ensure proper tagging and configuration for effective tracing. 3. Address high CPU usage in containers: optimize application code, adjust resource quotas, and monitor container performance."
