{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,  sum(duration)", 
	"reason": "The observed data indicates several key performance indicators (KPIs) are experiencing deviations from their expected behavior. Several KPIs, including 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', show a decline in performance after the change.  Furthermore, the 'message' KPI exhibits an unexpected shift in trend. These anomalies suggest potential issues with data processing, system resource utilization, or service interactions.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Resource Consumption:** Analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage during the period when these KPIs showed abnormal behavior. Identify any resource bottlenecks that could be impacting performance. 2. **Review Logs and Error Reports:** Examine system logs and error reports for any messages or events that correlate with the observed anomalies. This can provide insights into specific issues causing the problems. 3. **Performance Testing:** Conduct thorough performance testing to identify the root cause of the degradation in KPIs. Focus on scenarios that closely resemble real-world usage patterns. 4. **Code Review:** If applicable, review recent code changes to identify any potential bugs or regressions that might be contributing to the issues. 5. **Roll Back Changes:** Consider rolling back the recent changes if they are suspected to be the primary cause of the anomalies. This can help isolate the issue and facilitate further troubleshooting."
