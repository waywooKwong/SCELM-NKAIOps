	"reason": "Multiple KPIs indicate a significant shift in performance and potential anomalies.  'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' are showing unexpected trends. The 'message', 'sum(requests)', and 'error rate' KPIs suggest increased errors or communication issues. This combination points to a system-wide problem.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following:\n\n* **Resource Constraints:** Check CPU, memory, and network utilization for affected systems.\n* **Logs and Monitoring:** Analyze logs from services related to 'getBackupEmp', 'AuthListByName', and messaging components for error messages or performance bottlenecks.\n* **Code Review:** Examine recent code changes in the relevant areas for potential regressions.\n* **External Dependencies:** Verify the status of any external services relied upon by these systems."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The JSON response categorizes the change as a "failure" due to the substantial and concerning anomalies detected across multiple KPIs.  

Here's a breakdown of the fields:

* **`change_type`**: Set to "failure" because the provided data clearly indicates issues that go beyond normal fluctuations.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**: This list highlights five KPIs that stand out as primarily responsible for the failure indication.  The selection avoids KPIs named "build" as requested.  Remember, this is a suggested starting point for investigation. 
* **`reason`**: This field provides a concise explanation based on the observed data trends. The combination of performance degradation in specific areas and increased errors strongly suggests a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.
* **`solution`**: Offers actionable steps to address the potential root causes identified in the "reason" section.
