	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeDeptObjectIDs end ",
	"reason": "Several KPIs, particularly related to user authentication and system processes (e.g., 'AuthListByName', 'getBackupEmp success'), show significant deviations from their expected ranges. This suggests potential issues with user permissions, data retrieval, or underlying system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success' KPI:** Analyze logs and error messages to pinpoint the root cause of the decreased success rate. 2. **Review 'AuthListByName' metrics:** Check for any changes in user access policies or authentication configurations that could explain the observed shifts. 3. **Monitor system performance:** Track resource utilization (CPU, memory) for processes related to the affected KPIs. Identify potential bottlenecks or resource contention. 4. **Implement logging and monitoring enhancements:**  Increase logging granularity for critical functions and set up alerts for significant KPI deviations."
