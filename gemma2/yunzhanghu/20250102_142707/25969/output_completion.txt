Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **`change_type: "normal"`**:  This indicates that the provided metrics and data analysis suggest a normal operational state. There are no signs of significant deviations or failures.

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: ""**: Since there are no identified anomalies, this field remains empty.

* **`reason`**: This field explicitly states that the observed data falls within acceptable limits, implying a normal operating condition.

* **`solution`**: As there is no failure to address, this field is left blank. 



Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
