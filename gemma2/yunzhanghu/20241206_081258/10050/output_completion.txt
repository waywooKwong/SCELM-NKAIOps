	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction to zero, suggesting a possible policy loading failure. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit changes in their minimum and maximum values, implying disruptions in object ID retrieval and department management. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show altered ranges, suggesting problems with backup employee retrieval and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the policy loading process to determine the cause of the zero count in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and implement necessary fixes. Analyze the changes in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to identify the root cause of object ID retrieval and department management disruptions. Review the backup employee retrieval and authentication processes to address the issues reflected in 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'."
