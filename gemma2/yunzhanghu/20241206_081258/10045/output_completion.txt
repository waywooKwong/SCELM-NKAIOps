	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues. 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in values, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  also exhibit altered trends and ranges, pointing to potential errors or performance degradation in these functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue and address it. Analyze the changes in the other affected KPIs to identify the source of the problems and implement appropriate solutions. Consider rolling back the recent changes if the issues are severe and impacting critical functionalities."
