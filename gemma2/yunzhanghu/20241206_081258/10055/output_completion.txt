	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant change in system behavior. Several KPIs, particularly those related to network traffic (kpi 36) and object processing (kpi 30, 32, 33), show a shift towards higher values after the change. Additionally, KPIs like 'loaded policy count' (kpi 31) have drastically reduced values, suggesting potential issues with policy loading or enforcement. These changes suggest a possible resource contention or performance degradation issue.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the network traffic increase (kpi 36):** Analyze the network traffic patterns for pods and namespaces mentioned in the KPI description. Identify potential bottlenecks or increased communication volume. 2. **Review policy loading (kpi 31):** Check for errors or issues with policy deployment and loading mechanisms. Ensure policies are correctly applied and enforced. 3. **Monitor object processing (kpi 30, 32, 33):** Analyze the performance of object processing functions and identify potential areas for optimization. 4. **Resource monitoring:** Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk) to identify potential contention or overload issues. 5. **Log analysis:** Examine system logs for any error messages or warnings related to the observed changes."
