	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in data range, suggesting a possible policy loading problem. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit decreased minimum values and narrower ranges, hinting at performance bottlenecks or errors in object retrieval. 'message' shows a change in trend from down to up with a significant shift in the data range, indicating potential communication issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the reasons behind the policy loading issue and address any potential policy configuration errors. Analyze the performance bottlenecks in object retrieval and optimize the relevant code or infrastructure.  Examine the 'message' KPI for specific error messages or unusual patterns to identify and resolve communication issues."
