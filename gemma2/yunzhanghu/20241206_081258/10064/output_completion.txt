	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getPermTagsAndValues, container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty, approve status error",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in the metrics for several key performance indicators (KPIs).  Metrics like 'getPermTagsAndValues', 'container_cpu_usage_seconds_total', and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' show wider ranges and deviations from their previous trends, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or resource contention.  'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' also indicate potential issues with workflow execution or data processing. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource utilization:** Analyze the CPU and memory usage of the affected pods and nodes to identify potential bottlenecks. 2. **Review logs and error messages:**  Examine the logs of the affected services and components for any clues about the root cause of the performance degradation. 3. **Optimize code and configurations:** Review the code and configurations of the affected services to identify areas for optimization. 4. **Scale resources:** If necessary, scale up the resources allocated to the affected pods and nodes. 5. **Monitor and track:** Continuously monitor the affected KPIs and implement alerting mechanisms to proactively identify potential issues."
