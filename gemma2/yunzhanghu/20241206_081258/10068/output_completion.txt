	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Depts only have yunzhanghu, getPermTagsAndValues, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues. KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues', 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'superiorAndDeputy empty' show a shift in their mean values and ranges, suggesting a disruption in their expected behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to these KPIs to identify the root cause of the data range shifts. Review logs and monitor system performance for any anomalies that might correlate with the changes. Consider reverting the modification if the impact is severe and further analysis points to a regression."
