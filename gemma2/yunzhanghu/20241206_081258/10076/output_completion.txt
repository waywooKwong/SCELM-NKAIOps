	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in several key performance indicators after the change.  'superiorAndDeputy empty'  and 'approve status error' exhibit a downward trend, indicating potential issues with approval processes. ' <:REQ:>' and 'DeleteFieldValues <:REQ:>'  show a drastic decrease in values, suggesting problems with data retrieval or processing. 'svc.ApproveCallback failed' also shows a downward trend, further reinforcing the potential issues with approval workflows. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to the approval process and data retrieval.  Review logs and error messages for clues about the root cause of the issues. Consider rolling back the recent changes if they are identified as the primary cause of the problems. "
