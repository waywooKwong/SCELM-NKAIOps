	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their ranges after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'  went from having a wide range to a very narrow range of 0. This suggests a potential issue with data collection or processing. Additionally, 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'getBackupEmp success'  show changes in their mean values and trends, indicating potential performance or functionality issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the data collection pipelines for 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' to ensure data is being captured correctly. Analyze the logs and metrics for 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success', and 'getBackupEmp success' to pinpoint the root cause of the changes in their performance and trends. Consider implementing monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify and address future issues."
