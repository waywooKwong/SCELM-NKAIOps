	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic decrease in minimum value and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit a noticeable increase in maximum values. This suggests potential issues with policy loading, department membership, backup operations, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes implemented to identify the root cause of these shifts. Review the logs and monitoring data for any errors or warnings related to policy loading, department management, backup operations, and authentication. Consider reverting the changes or implementing mitigating measures to restore the KPIs to their previous ranges."
