	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' show increased maximum values and shifted trends, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or resource contention. 'getBackupEmp success' shows a similar trend with a wider range and a change in trend direction.",
	"solution": "Investigate the reasons behind the changes in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'. Analyze the logs and system resources to identify potential bottlenecks or errors. Optimize the code and configurations related to policy loading, object retrieval, and resource management. Monitor the affected KPIs closely after implementing the solution."
