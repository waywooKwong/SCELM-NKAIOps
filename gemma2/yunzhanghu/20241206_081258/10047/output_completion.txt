	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in the performance of several key metrics after the change.  Metrics like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to 0, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show negative trends, indicating potential problems with department management, backup operations, authentication, and object retrieval. These anomalies collectively point to a failure scenario.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:**  Examine the policy loading process and identify any errors or bottlenecks. 2. **Review department management processes:** Analyze the 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' metric to understand if there are issues with department configuration or data synchronization. 3. **Troubleshoot backup operations:** Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success' metric to identify any failures or delays in backup processes. 4. **Examine authentication mechanisms:** Analyze the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' metric to pinpoint any authentication errors or performance issues. 5. **Optimize object retrieval:**  Investigate the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' metric to identify any inefficiencies or bottlenecks in object retrieval processes."
