	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in the distribution of several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit drastically reduced ranges, indicating potential issues with policy loading and department member management.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'getBackupEmp success' also show changes in their distributions, suggesting problems with object retrieval and backup operations. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a change in its distribution, indicating potential issues with user authentication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made and their impact on the affected systems. Review logs and system configurations to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.  Consider rolling back the recent changes if they are identified as the primary cause.  Additionally, monitor the affected KPIs closely and implement corrective measures to restore normal performance."
