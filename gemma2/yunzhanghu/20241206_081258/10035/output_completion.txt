	"reason": "While some KPIs show shifts in their ranges after the change, these are not necessarily indicative of a failure.  The overall trends remain largely consistent (up or down) and the magnitudes of change seem within reasonable bounds.  The 'loaded policy count' KPI dropping to zero might require investigation, but it's possible this is a normal state after the change.",
	"solution": "No immediate solution is required as the changes appear to be within expected parameters. Further monitoring of the 'loaded policy count' KPI is recommended."

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: normal** - The provided data doesn't clearly point to a catastrophic failure. Some KPIs have changed, but these changes don't necessarily indicate a problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  I've selected KPIs that show the most significant changes or unusual behavior.  Note that I've excluded KPIs named "build" as requested.
* **reason:** The analysis emphasizes that while changes exist, they don't definitively point to a failure. The 'loaded policy count' KPI's behavior warrants attention.
* **solution:**  The response recommends continued monitoring of the 'loaded policy count' KPI to understand its long-term behavior. 



Let me know if you have any more questions or would like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the analysis!
