{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has a much smaller range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' also show significant shifts in their ranges, suggesting potential problems with object ID management, department structure, and message processing.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made and their impact on these KPIs. Analyze logs and system configurations to pinpoint the root cause of the data range shifts. Consider reverting the changes if they are identified as the primary cause of the anomalies. If the changes are necessary, implement mitigating strategies to address the observed issues."
