	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their data ranges and trends after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' decreased dramatically, while 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success' and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' all show upward trends. This suggests potential issues with policy loading, object retrieval, and network communication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced with the update to identify the root cause of these anomalies.  Review logs and system metrics related to policy loading, object retrieval, and network traffic.  Consider reverting the changes or applying targeted fixes to restore normal KPI behavior."
