	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction to zero, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit reversed trends, indicating possible problems with object ID management and department structure. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show concerning changes, hinting at difficulties with user authentication and information retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue ('loaded policy count:<:NUM:>') by reviewing logs and system configurations. Analyze the reversed trends in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to identify any changes in object ID management or department structures. Examine the logs and authentication mechanisms related to 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint the source of authentication and information retrieval problems. Once the root causes are identified, implement appropriate solutions to restore normal KPI behavior."
