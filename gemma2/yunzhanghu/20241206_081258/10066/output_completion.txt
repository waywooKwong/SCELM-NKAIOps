	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Depts only have yunzhanghu, getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success,  superiorAndDeputy empty",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant shifts in their ranges and trends after the change. Notably, 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>' and 'parseDataReportFlag ok' exhibit a wider range and a downward trend, suggesting potential issues with data processing or access permissions. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' drops to a range of [0.0,0.0] indicating a complete failure in the interval success rate. 'superiorAndDeputy empty' shows a similar trend with a reduced range and a downward trend. These anomalies collectively point towards a failure in the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes made:** Carefully review the code changes introduced to pinpoint the exact modifications that might have caused these issues. 2. **Analyze log files:** Examine system logs for any error messages or warnings related to the affected KPIs. This can provide valuable insights into the root cause of the problems. 3. **Monitor system performance:** Track the performance of the affected components closely to identify any bottlenecks or resource constraints that might be contributing to the anomalies. 4. **Roll back the changes:** If possible, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the system to a stable state. 5. **Test thoroughly:** Once the issue is resolved, perform comprehensive testing to ensure that the system is functioning correctly and that the anomalies have been eliminated."
