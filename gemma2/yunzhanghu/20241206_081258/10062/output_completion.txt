	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_network_receive_bytes_total, getPermTagsAndValues, loadRegoMySQLInterval success,  parseDataReportFlag ok, superiorAndDeputy empty",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant decrease in container network receive bytes, a drop in getPermTagsAndValues, and a complete halt in loadRegoMySQLInterval success. Additionally, parseDataReportFlag ok and superiorAndDeputy empty show unexpected downward trends. This suggests potential issues with network connectivity, data retrieval, and system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate network connectivity to the affected pods. Check the logs and configuration of the service responsible for getPermTagsAndValues. Analyze the cause of the loadRegoMySQLInterval success failure and ensure the MySQL connection is working. Monitor the parseDataReportFlag ok and superiorAndDeputy empty metrics closely for further insights. Consider restarting affected services or pods to resolve potential transient issues."
