	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in performance after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' which dropped to a constant 0, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message', show negative changes in their ranges and trends. This suggests potential issues with policy loading, data retrieval, and system communication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the impact of the change on the affected systems. Analyze logs and error messages to pinpoint the root cause of the performance degradation. Consider rolling back the change or implementing mitigating strategies to restore normal functionality."
