	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly shifted after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic decrease in minimum and maximum values, while 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit similar trends with reduced ranges. 'message' shows a significant shift from an upward trend to a downward trend. This suggests that the change might have negatively impacted these functionalities.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced and identify the specific modifications that could be affecting these KPIs.  Review the logs and error messages for any clues related to the issues. Consider reverting the changes or implementing targeted fixes to restore the KPIs to their normal ranges."
