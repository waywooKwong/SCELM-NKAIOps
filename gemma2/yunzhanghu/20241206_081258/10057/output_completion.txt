	"reason": "While there are some anomalies detected, the overall trend suggests a shift in data distribution rather than a critical failure. KPIs like 'loaded policy count' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show a narrowing range, potentially indicating a successful optimization.  Other KPIs like 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' show a slight improvement in their range.  It's important to monitor these changes further.",
	"solution": "Continue monitoring the KPIs mentioned above. Investigate the reasons behind the narrowing range of 'loaded policy count' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'. Analyze the slight improvements in 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' to understand the contributing factors."
