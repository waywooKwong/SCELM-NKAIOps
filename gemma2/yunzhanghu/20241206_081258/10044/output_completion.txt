{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification. Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' also exhibit notable shifts in their ranges, suggesting potential problems in object retrieval, department management, and message processing.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made to the system and identify the root cause of the data range shifts. Focus on the affected KPIs, such as 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', to pinpoint the source of the issue. Review logs and system configurations for clues, and consider rolling back the changes if necessary. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar anomalies in the future."
