	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their data ranges after the change, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has a drastic reduction in its range, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show shifts in their minimum and maximum values, indicating potential problems with object retrieval or department membership. 'getBackupEmp success' also exhibits a change in its range, suggesting potential issues with backup operations. 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' indicates a potential network issue.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following areas to identify the root cause:\n* **Policy Loading:** Examine the logs and configuration related to policy loading for 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' to understand why the range has drastically reduced.\n* **Object Retrieval:** Analyze the performance of 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to pinpoint potential bottlenecks or errors in object retrieval.\n* **Backup Operations:** Review the logs and configuration of 'getBackupEmp success' to identify any issues with backup execution.\n* **Network Traffic:** Analyze the network traffic captured by 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' to identify any abnormal spikes or patterns that might indicate a network issue."
