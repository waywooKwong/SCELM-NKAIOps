	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant shifts in their ranges and trends after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in its minimum value and a shift towards positive values, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success' all show changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting potential problems with data retrieval or processing. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also shows a change in its range, potentially indicating an issue with authentication or authorization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made and their impact on the affected KPIs. Review logs and system metrics for any errors or performance bottlenecks.  Consider reverting the changes or implementing temporary fixes to mitigate the impact. Further analysis of the specific data changes and error messages is required to pinpoint the root cause and suggest a permanent solution."
