	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in data ranges and trends after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', exhibit a drastic reduction in range and a change in trend. This suggests a potential issue with data loading or processing after the implementation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made and their impact on data loading and processing pipelines. Review logs and error messages for any clues related to the observed anomalies. Consider rolling back the changes if the issue persists after thorough investigation."
