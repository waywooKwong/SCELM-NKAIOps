	"reason": "The data ranges of several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification, indicating potential issues.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  shows a drastic reduction, suggesting a problem with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', and 'getBackupEmp success'  demonstrate changes in data distribution, implying potential errors in object retrieval or backup processes. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a shift from an upward trend to a downward trend, indicating potential issues with authentication or user information retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to policy loading, object retrieval, backup processes, and authentication mechanisms. Analyze logs and error messages to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. Consider reverting the changes or implementing fixes to restore the expected behavior."
