	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in values, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show changes in trend and range, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval, department management, backup operations, and authentication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and ensure policies are being loaded correctly. Analyze the trends and ranges of 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to pinpoint specific issues and implement solutions to restore normal functionality."
