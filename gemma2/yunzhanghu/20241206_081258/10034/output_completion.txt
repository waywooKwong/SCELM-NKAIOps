	"reason": "The metrics data indicates a significant change in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' has drastically reduced, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading or deployment. Other KPIs like 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' show negative trends or unusual fluctuations, indicating potential performance degradation or resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and other affected KPIs. Review recent code changes, configuration updates, or system logs for potential clues. Monitor system resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) to identify bottlenecks. Consider reverting the recent change if it appears to be the primary cause of the issues. "
