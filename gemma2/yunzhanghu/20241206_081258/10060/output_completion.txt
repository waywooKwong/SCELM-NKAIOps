	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "31.kpi name: approve status error, 32.kpi name: irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",container=\"\",namespace=~\"jiesuan\",pod=~\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd\",metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"} [1m]) * 100, 33.kpi name: rego exec input:<:MAP:>, 38.kpi name: <:GIN:>, 39.kpi name: Depts only have yunzhanghu",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift in several KPIs after the change.  Approve status error rate increased, CPU usage spiked, Rego exec input had larger fluctuations, and 'GIN' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' metrics also showed unusual changes. This indicates potential issues with the deployment or configuration.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the approve status error:** Analyze the logs and system behavior to understand the root cause of the increased error rate. 2. **Monitor CPU usage:**  Implement proactive monitoring and alerting for high CPU usage. Investigate resource contention and optimize resource allocation. 3. **Review Rego exec input:** Analyze the changes in Rego input and their impact on the system.  Ensure the input data is correct and consistent. 4. **Examine 'GIN' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' metrics:**  Identify the source of these metrics and investigate the changes. 5. **Rollback the change:** If possible, rollback the recent change to revert to a stable state while further investigation is conducted."
