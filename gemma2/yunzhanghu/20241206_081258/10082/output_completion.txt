	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have significantly changed after the modification.  Specifically, KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and 'callback status error' show a downward trend in their mean values and a reduction in their ranges, indicating a potential decrease in request rates and successful callback operations. Other KPIs like 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' and 'get metadata from header' also exhibit altered ranges, suggesting potential issues with data retrieval or processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made to identify the specific changes that might be impacting these KPIs. 2. **Monitor logs and error messages:** Analyze logs and error messages for any clues about the reasons behind the altered KPI values. 3. **Test and debug:** Conduct thorough testing to pinpoint the source of the issue and debug the affected code. 4. **Revert changes if necessary:** If the issue persists after debugging, consider reverting the recent code changes and analyzing the impact on KPIs. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting systems to track the KPIs and receive notifications when significant deviations occur, enabling proactive issue identification and resolution."
