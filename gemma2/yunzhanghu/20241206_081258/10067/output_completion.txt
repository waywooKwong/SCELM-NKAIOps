	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Depts only have yunzhanghu, getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>, parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, build <:*:>[trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in range and trend after the change.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>' , 'parseDataReportFlag ok', 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success'  all exhibit  shifted ranges and reversed trends, indicating potential issues with data processing or system behavior. 'build <:*:>[trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:> ' also shows a drastic reduction in range, suggesting potential problems with data collection or processing within this specific context.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes**: Carefully review the code changes made to pinpoint the exact modifications that might be causing these anomalies. 2. **Monitor logs and error messages**: Analyze logs and error messages for any clues related to the affected KPIs. 3. **Compare data before and after the change**: Conduct a detailed comparison of data from before and after the change to identify specific data points or patterns that have been affected. 4. **Rollback the changes**: If possible, temporarily rollback the changes to see if the anomalies disappear. This can help isolate the root cause of the issue. 5. **Consult with developers and engineers**: Engage with developers and engineers who are familiar with the codebase and system architecture to gather insights and potential solutions."
