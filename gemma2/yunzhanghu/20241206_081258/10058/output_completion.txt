	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, loadRegoMySQLInterval success,  getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' have narrowed down to 0, indicating a potential issue with data collection or processing. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' shows an upward trend in the mean, suggesting a possible change in the system's behavior. 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' also show a reduction in data range, indicating potential problems with these operations.",
	"solution": "Investigate the data collection and processing pipelines for the affected KPIs. Analyze the changes in the system's behavior reflected in the 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPI. Review the logs and error messages for 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' and 'getBackupEmp success' to identify the root cause of the reduced data range."
