	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, build <:*:>, message",
	"reason": "The data shows a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  dropped to zero, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' experienced a change in trend, suggesting potential problems with object ID management and department configuration. 'build <:*:>'  and 'message' also show anomalies, pointing to broader system instability. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:**  Check for errors in policy loading, configuration, or access permissions. 2. **Review object ID management:** Analyze 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' for potential conflicts or inconsistencies. 3. **Monitor 'build <:*:>' and 'message' for further clues:**  Analyze logs and system events related to these KPIs to identify the root cause of the anomalies. 4. **Rollback the change if necessary:** If the issue persists, consider reverting the recent changes to restore previous functionality. 5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:**  Set up robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect future anomalies and prevent similar issues."
