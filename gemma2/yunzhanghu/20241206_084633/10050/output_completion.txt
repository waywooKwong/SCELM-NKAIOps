	"reason": "The metrics show a significant decrease in the range of several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This indicates that the change may have negatively impacted the system's performance. Specifically, KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to zero, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show reduced ranges, hinting at potential problems with object retrieval and authorization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made and identify the specific modifications that could be causing these performance issues. Review logs and error messages for any clues about the root cause. Consider reverting the change or implementing a rollback strategy to restore the previous system state. Once the root cause is identified, develop a solution to address the issue and retest the system thoroughly."
