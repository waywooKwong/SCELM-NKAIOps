	"reason": "The data shows a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to 0, indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' exhibit upward trends, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show negative trends, implying problems with authentication and user management. These anomalies suggest a widespread impact on system functionality.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue ('loaded policy count:<:NUM:>') and address any underlying configuration or deployment problems. Analyze the performance bottlenecks in 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' by examining resource utilization and code execution. Review the authentication and user management processes to identify and resolve the issues affecting 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'."
