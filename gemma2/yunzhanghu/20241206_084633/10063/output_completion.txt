	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in performance after the change. Multiple KPIs, including those related to network traffic, data processing, and memory usage, show degraded performance with wider ranges and negative trends. This suggests potential issues with the code or infrastructure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes**: Carefully review the code changes implemented after the baseline to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences affecting these KPIs. 2. **Monitor system resources**: Track CPU, memory, and network utilization to pinpoint resource bottlenecks. 3. **Analyze logs**: Examine application and system logs for errors or warnings that might shed light on the performance issues. 4. **Test and rollback**: If possible, revert the changes and test the system again to isolate the root cause. 5. **Optimize code and infrastructure**: Based on the analysis, implement optimizations to improve code efficiency and resource utilization."
