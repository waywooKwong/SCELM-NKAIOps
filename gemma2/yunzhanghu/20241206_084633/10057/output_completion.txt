	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "GIN, loaded policy count, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in range and trend after the change.  'GIN', 'loaded policy count', 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu'  indicate potential issues with data processing or system behavior. 'getBackupEmp success' shows a shift in success rate, suggesting potential problems with backup operations.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made and their impact on the affected KPIs. Review logs and system metrics for further insights.  Consider reverting the changes if they are causing significant negative effects.  Address the root cause of the issues identified to restore normal system operation."
