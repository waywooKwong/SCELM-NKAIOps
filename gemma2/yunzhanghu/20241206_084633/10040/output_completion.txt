	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant changes in their data ranges after the change.  For example, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  decreases significantly, indicating potential issues with policy loading. Similarly, 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show increased ranges, suggesting potential problems with object retrieval and department management.  The 'getBackupEmp success' KPI also shows a decrease in range, implying potential issues with backup processes.  Finally, 'sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8' shows an increase in range, indicating potential network issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes in these KPIs to identify the root cause.  Review logs, monitor system resources, and analyze code changes to pinpoint the source of the issue.  Once identified, implement appropriate solutions to address the problems, such as optimizing policy loading, improving object retrieval efficiency, resolving backup process errors, and addressing network congestion."
