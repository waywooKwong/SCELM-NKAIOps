	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m])), <:list modules:>, callback status error, getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>, get metadata from header",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' indicates a decrease in request rate, while '<:list modules:>' shows a downward trend in module performance. 'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>'  experience negative shifts, suggesting potential issues with error handling and data retrieval. 'get metadata from header' also exhibits a decline. These changes collectively point to a negative impact on system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced during the change to identify potential root causes for the observed KPI deviations. 2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze system logs for error messages or warnings that might shed light on the issues affecting the KPIs. 3. **Test and debug:** Implement thorough testing to pinpoint the specific areas where the changes are causing problems. Debug the code to resolve any identified issues. 4. **Roll back the change:** If the issues are severe or difficult to resolve, consider rolling back the change to the previous stable state while further investigation and debugging are conducted. 5. **Gradual deployment:** Implement future changes incrementally to minimize the impact on system performance and allow for easier identification and resolution of issues."
