	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant decline in performance for several key KPIs after the change. Notably, 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' dropped sharply, suggesting issues with request handling.  'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' also show negative trends, indicating potential problems with service calls and data retrieval. 'get metadata from header' and 'ClientEnvHandler is <:*:>' are experiencing unexpected changes, pointing to broader system instability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the root cause of the performance degradation. Focus on areas related to request handling, service calls, and data retrieval. Review logs and system monitoring data for further insights. Consider rolling back the changes if the issue cannot be quickly resolved."
