	"reason": "The metrics show a significant decrease in the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. Additionally, several other KPIs, including 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'build <:*:>' and 'message', exhibit unusual trends, suggesting broader system instability. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue.  Review logs and system configurations related to policy management.  Monitor the affected KPIs closely and identify any correlated events. Consider rolling back recent changes if applicable. "
