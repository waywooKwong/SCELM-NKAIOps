	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method), message,  60s window of http_requests_total > 2 times the average in last 5 minutes",
	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their expected behavior. Notably, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'getBackupEmp success' show increased variability, suggesting potential issues with authentication or data retrieval processes.  Additionally, anomalies are observed in the request rate metrics ('sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (method)') indicating a potential surge in traffic.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate authentication processes:** Review logs and configurations related to 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify any errors or inconsistencies that might be causing the observed fluctuations. 2. **Analyze data retrieval performance:** Examine logs and metrics for 'getBackupEmp success' to pinpoint bottlenecks or issues hindering efficient data fetching. 3. **Monitor and optimize request rates:**  Implement load balancing strategies, rate limiting, or caching mechanisms to manage traffic spikes and prevent system overload."
