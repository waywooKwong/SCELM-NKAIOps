	"reason": "The data analysis reveals that several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their expected patterns, indicating potential system issues or performance degradation. For example, 'getBackupEmp success' shows a decrease in success rate, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' displays an altered trend, and 'message' experiences a change in distribution.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the decreased success rate for 'getBackupEmp success'.** This could involve examining error logs, database performance, or external dependencies.\n2. **Analyze the changes in the trend of 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify contributing factors.**  This might require reviewing recent code changes or system configurations.\n3. **Monitor the distribution changes in 'message' and correlate them with any other anomalies detected.** This could help pinpoint the source of the issue and its impact on the system.\n4. Implement appropriate monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect future deviations from normal behavior."
