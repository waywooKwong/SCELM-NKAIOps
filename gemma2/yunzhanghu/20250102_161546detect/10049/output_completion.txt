	"reason": "The system experienced significant performance degradation and anomalies in several key metrics after the change. This is evidenced by a sharp increase in error rates, latency spikes, and unexpected deviations from normal behavior patterns.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies by examining logs, monitoring metrics closely, and reviewing recent code changes. Focus on the identified top 5 abnormal KPIs (excluding 'build' related KPIs) to pinpoint the source of the issues. Once identified, implement appropriate solutions such as bug fixes, resource optimization, or configuration adjustments."
