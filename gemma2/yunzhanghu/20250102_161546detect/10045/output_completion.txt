	"reason": "The analysis of the provided metrics indicates a potential failure. Several KPIs, including 'sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8)', 'getBackupEmp success', 'authenticate user', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'message', show significant deviations from their expected behavior. This suggests a possible performance degradation or malfunction within the system.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of these anomalies.  Recommendations include:\n* Monitoring resource consumption (CPU, memory) of affected pods.\n* Examining logs for error messages related to 'getBackupEmp success', authentication, and object processing.\n* Verifying the configuration of deployed pods and their dependencies.\n* Testing the system's resilience against load fluctuations."
