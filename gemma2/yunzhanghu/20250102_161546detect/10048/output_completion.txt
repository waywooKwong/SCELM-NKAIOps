{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, message, computeOwnObjectIDs end,  computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected behavior. Notably, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibits a downward trend, while 'getBackupEmp success' and 'message'  display anomalies in their ranges. Additionally, 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' shows unusual fluctuations.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies by examining logs, resource utilization, and recent code changes. Focus on the affected systems ('AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'getBackupEmp success', 'message', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end') and identify any potential issues with authentication, database operations, or messaging services."
}
``` 


**Explanation of Changes:**

* **`change_type`:** Set to "failure" because the provided data indicates multiple KPIs exhibiting abnormal behavior.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`:**  Selected the most significantly deviating KPIs based on the descriptions and excluded KPIs named with 'build' as requested.
* **`reason`:** A concise explanation outlining the observed anomalies in specific KPIs and suggesting potential areas for investigation.
* **`solution`:** A structured approach to addressing the failure, emphasizing root cause analysis, system-specific investigations, and focusing on relevant services.
