	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant shift in performance. Several key KPIs show either a drop or spike in values beyond their expected ranges. This suggests potential issues with system stability, resource contention, or external dependencies.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the top 5 abnormal kpis:** Analyze logs and system resources related to these KPIs to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies.\n2. **Monitor resource usage:**  Check CPU, memory, and network utilization to identify any bottlenecks or excessive consumption.\n3. **Review recent changes:** Assess if any recent code deployments, configuration updates, or infrastructure modifications could have contributed to the performance degradation.\n4. **Scale resources as needed:** If resource contention is identified, consider scaling up server capacity or optimizing resource allocation.\n5. **Implement logging and monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring systems to proactively detect and respond to future performance issues."
