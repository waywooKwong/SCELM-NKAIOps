	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their expected behavior. For example, 'message' exhibits a sharp drop in mean value and 'AuthListByName' shows an upward trend despite expectations of stability. This indicates potential underlying issues within the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes implemented recently:** Identify any recent code updates or configuration modifications that might have impacted these KPIs. 2. **Analyze log files and error reports:** Look for any specific error messages or warnings related to the affected components. 3. **Monitor resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify any bottlenecks or resource contention issues. 4. **Perform stress testing:** Simulate high-load scenarios to assess the system's resilience and identify potential weaknesses."
