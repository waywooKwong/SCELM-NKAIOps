Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All indicators are within acceptable thresholds and do not exceed predefined limits.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


Let me explain the reasoning:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`**  The provided data indicates that no KPIs have exceeded their thresholds or exhibited significant deviations from expected behavior. This suggests a normal operating state. 

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "" `** Since there are no abnormal KPIs, this field is left blank.

* **`reason`**: I've clearly stated that all indicators are within acceptable ranges, implying a normal system state.
*  **`solution`**: No solution is necessary because there is no identified problem.



Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
