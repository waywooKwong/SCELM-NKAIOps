	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant performance degradation. Several key KPIs like AuthListByName, getBackupEmp success, and message exhibit unusual fluctuations and increased latency. Additionally, the container CPU and memory utilization are spiking, suggesting resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate potential bottlenecks in the system by analyzing logs and tracing requests related to the affected KPIs. Consider scaling up resources (CPU/memory) if necessary. Optimize code performance, identify and resolve any inefficient queries or operations contributing to the spikes."
