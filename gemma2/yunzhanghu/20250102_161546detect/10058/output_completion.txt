	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from expected patterns, indicating potential issues with authentication, backup processes, and object retrieval. The metrics suggest performance degradation and anomalies in these critical areas.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the cause of AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> fluctuations**: Analyze logs and system events for any errors or unusual activity related to authentication.  \n2. **Review getBackupEmp_success metrics**: Check backup configurations, job schedules, and storage systems for potential bottlenecks or failures.\n3. **Monitor performance of computeOwnObjectIDs end**: Identify resource contention or inefficient code execution impacting object retrieval speed."
