	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>,getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end,computeDeptObjectIDs end ",
	"reason": "The data for several KPIs indicates a potential issue. Message exhibits significant deviation in mean value,  AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:> shows a drastic reduction in range, and getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and computeDeptObjectIDs end  all display unusual trends suggesting system performance degradation or anomalies.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the 'message' KPI deviation:** Analyze logs, monitor network traffic, and review code related to message handling for potential errors or bottlenecks. \n2. **Examine the reasons behind the reduced range in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'**: Verify authentication configurations and data sources to ensure proper functionality and data consistency.\n3. **Scrutinize getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end, and computeDeptObjectIDs end for anomalies:** Profile code execution, analyze database queries, and monitor resource utilization to pinpoint performance bottlenecks or faulty logic."
