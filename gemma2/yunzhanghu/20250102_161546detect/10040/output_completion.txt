	"reason": "The analysis of the provided KPI data reveals several significant deviations from expected patterns. KPIs such as 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'message' exhibit substantial changes in their distribution, indicating potential issues within the system.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies.  A comprehensive approach should include:\n* **Reviewing logs:** Analyzing system and application logs for error messages or unusual events correlated with the affected KPIs.\n* **Monitoring resource utilization:** Checking CPU, memory, and network usage to identify bottlenecks or resource contention.\n* **Examining code changes:** Scrutinizing recent code modifications for potential regressions or unintended consequences.\n* **Testing and debugging:**  Performing targeted tests to isolate the source of the issues and implement corrective measures."
