	"reason": "The provided anomaly metrics strongly indicate a failure.  The specific mention of \"Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes\" suggests a critical issue with the software deployed. Furthermore, the newly generated log pattern and multiple anomaly flags identified by the SCWARN algorithm within a short timeframe point to significant deviations from expected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Roll Back:** Immediately revert to the previous stable version of the software to mitigate the ongoing issues.\n2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the exact cause of the incorrect IP address configuration and defective software changes. This may involve reviewing code commits, deployment logs, and system configurations.\n3. **Fix and Retest:** Once the root cause is identified, implement the necessary fixes and thoroughly test the corrected code in a controlled environment before re-deploying it to production.\n4. **Change Management Review:** Evaluate the change management process followed for this change to identify any weaknesses or areas for improvement. Implement stricter controls and procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future."
