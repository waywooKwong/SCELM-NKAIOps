	"reason": "The provided information explicitly states 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' as the root cause. This strongly indicates a failure as these issues directly impact system functionality and are not normal deviations.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediate Investigation:**  Thoroughly investigate the source of the incorrect IP addresses and software defects. \n2. **Rollback if Necessary:** If the impact is severe, consider rolling back to a stable configuration while fixing the issues. \n3. **Configuration Review:** Carefully review all system configurations related to IP addressing and software deployment.\n4. **Code Audit:** Conduct a thorough code audit to identify the defective software changes and rectify them.\n5. **Testing and Validation:** Implement rigorous testing after fixes to ensure proper functionality and prevent reoccurrences."
