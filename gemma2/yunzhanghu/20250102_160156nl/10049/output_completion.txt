	"reason": "The provided anomaly metrics directly indicate a failure.  'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' strongly suggests a software issue causing incorrect configuration and likely impacting system functionality. The SCWARN algorithm flagging anomalies at multiple timestamps further supports this conclusion.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediate Rollback:** If possible, revert the recent change to a known working state to restore service stability. 2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the specific code or configuration errors causing the IP address issue. 3. **Repair and Retest:** Correct the identified defects and implement rigorous testing to ensure the fix resolves the problem and doesn't introduce new issues. 4. **Monitor System Health:** Closely monitor system performance and logs after implementing the solution to ensure stability and prevent recurrence."
