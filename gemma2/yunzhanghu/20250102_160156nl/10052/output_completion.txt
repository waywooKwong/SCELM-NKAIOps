	"reason": "The provided anomaly metrics directly indicate a failure.  'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' point to a critical issue with the software deployment or configuration. The fact that these anomalies were identified by the SCWARN algorithm further strengthens the indication of a failed change.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback:** Immediately revert the recent change to a known working state. 2. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the incorrect IP address configuration and software defects. 3. **Remediation:**  Correct the faulty code or configuration, thoroughly test the fix, and implement it in a controlled environment before deploying to production. 4. **Change Management Review:** Analyze the change management process to identify any gaps that contributed to this failure and implement improvements to prevent similar issues in the future."
