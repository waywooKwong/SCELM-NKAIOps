	"reason": "The provided data indicates clear anomalies directly related to the change.  Specifically, 'Wrong IP Address,' 'Configuration Errors,' and 'Defective Software Changes' were identified as issues. This strongly suggests that the implemented changes introduced problems into the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediate Rollback**: Given the severity of these anomalies, immediately roll back the recent changes to restore the previous working state. 2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the precise cause of these issues within the code changes.  3. **Remediation and Testing**: Once the root cause is identified, implement fixes and perform rigorous testing to ensure the problem is resolved and does not reoccur. 4. **Enhanced Change Management**: Review and potentially strengthen change management processes to prevent similar issues in future deployments."
