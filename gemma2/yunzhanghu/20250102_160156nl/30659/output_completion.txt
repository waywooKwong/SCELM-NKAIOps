Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The SCWARN algorithm did not identify any anomalies during the analysis period. All indicator data remained within expected thresholds.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

Based on the provided information, the change appears to be normal.  Here's why:

* **No Anomalies Detected:** The SCWARN algorithm, responsible for identifying anomalies, reported no faults during the analysis period. This strongly suggests that the changes did not negatively impact system performance or introduce unexpected behavior.
* **Threshold Compliance:** The text states that all indicator data stayed within established thresholds.  This indicates that key performance metrics remained stable and within acceptable ranges.
