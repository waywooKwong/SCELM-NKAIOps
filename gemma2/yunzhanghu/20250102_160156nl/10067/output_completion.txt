{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "CPU Usage, Memory Consumption, Request Latency, Error Rate, Throughput",
	"reason": "The SCWARN algorithm identified numerous anomalies across various KPIs within a short timeframe.  This strongly suggests the recent changes introduced issues impacting system performance and stability. The observed symptoms align with 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes', indicating a potential misconfiguration or bug in the deployed code.",
	"solution": "1. **Immediate Rollback:** Prioritize rolling back the recent changes to restore the system to its previous stable state. 2. **Investigate Configuration Errors:**  Carefully review any recent configuration updates, focusing on IP address settings, network configurations, and software dependencies. 3. **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of the deployed changes to identify potential bugs or logical errors that might be causing performance issues. 4. **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement robust monitoring and logging mechanisms to capture system behavior in real-time and provide detailed insights into the root cause of the failures."
