	"reason": "The provided data indicates clear anomalies with specific mention of 'Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes'. This strongly suggests a failure as these are indicators of incorrect software implementation or configuration.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback:** If possible, immediately rollback the recent change to restore the previous stable state. 2. **Debugging:** Thoroughly investigate the code changes and configuration files to identify the root cause of the IP address issue and software defects. 3. **Remediation:** Correct the identified issues in the code and configuration. 4. **Testing:** After remediation, conduct rigorous testing to ensure that the fix resolves the problem and does not introduce new issues. 5. **Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring to detect similar anomalies in the future and facilitate quicker response times."
