{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message\ngetBackupEmp success\nAuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>\ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end\ncomputeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data analysis reveals several KPIs exhibiting significant deviations from expected patterns.  Metrics like 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show drastic changes in their minimum, maximum, and mean values after the change. This indicates potential issues with the system's performance or functionality.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the codebase**:  Scrutinize recent code modifications related to the affected KPIs. Identify any potential bugs or unintended side effects introduced during development. 2. **Monitor logs**: Analyze system and application logs for errors, warnings, or unusual events coinciding with the observed changes in KPIs. 3. **Review configuration files**: Ensure that relevant configuration settings have not been inadvertently modified and are aligned with expected behavior. 4. **Conduct load testing**: Simulate realistic user loads to assess the system's capacity and identify performance bottlenecks. 5. **Roll back recent changes**: If possible, revert recent code changes or configurations to a stable state and re-evaluate KPI behavior."
