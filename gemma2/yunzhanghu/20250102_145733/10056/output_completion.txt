	"reason": "Several KPIs exhibit significant deviations from their normal ranges, indicating potential issues. The 'getBackupEmp success' KPI shows an upward trend, while the 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPI experiences a downward shift. Furthermore, the 'message' KPI demonstrates a positive trend, suggesting increased activity or possibly errors.  The 'sum(requests)' KPI shows a spike, and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'  shows an abnormal increase. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message' KPIs for root causes of these deviations. Analyze the logs and system resources related to these functionalities. If the 'sum(requests)' KPI spike is persistent, review application performance and identify potential bottlenecks.  Monitor the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPI closely and examine if there are changes in data access patterns or processing requirements."
