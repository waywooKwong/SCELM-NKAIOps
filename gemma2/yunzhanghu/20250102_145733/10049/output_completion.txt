	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success,computeOwnObjectIDs end,AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, message,sum(requests)",
	"reason": "The data analysis shows significant deviations in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'message', and 'sum(requests)' exhibit substantial increases or decreases in their metrics compared to the baseline. This indicates potential issues with data retrieval, object processing, authentication mechanisms, and system load.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'getBackupEmp success' anomaly:** Analyze backup logs and system performance during backup operations to identify bottlenecks or errors affecting the success rate. 2. **Review 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' metrics:** Examine code related to object ID computation for potential inefficiencies or logic flaws causing increased processing times. 3. **Assess 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' behavior:**  Scrutinize authentication processes and access controls to rule out any issues with user authorization or data retrieval. 4. **Monitor 'message' performance:** Analyze message queues and communication patterns for potential blockages or delays affecting message processing. 5. **Optimize system load:** Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) and implement scaling strategies if necessary to handle increased request volumes."
