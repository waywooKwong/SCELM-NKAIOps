	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message,  sum(duration)",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant increase in anomalies across multiple KPIs after the change. This suggests potential issues with system performance, resource utilization, or logical errors introduced by the recent modification.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the top 5 abnormal KPIs in detail to pinpoint the root cause of the increased anomalies.  2. Review the code changes associated with the recent modification and identify any potential defects or unintended consequences. 3. Monitor system logs and error messages for clues about the nature of the failures. 4. Consider rolling back the recent changes if they are confirmed as the primary source of the problems. 5. Implement appropriate monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect anomalies in real time and facilitate faster issue resolution."
