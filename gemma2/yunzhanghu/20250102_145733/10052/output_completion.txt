	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(total_memory): The total memory usage is significantly higher than normal. \n sum(cpu_usage): CPU utilization has spiked unexpectedly.\n sum(disk_io): Disk I/O operations are exceeding acceptable levels.\nsum(network_traffic): Network traffic has surged beyond usual patterns. \nsum(requests_per_second): The number of incoming requests is significantly elevated.",
	"reason": "The provided metrics indicate a significant performance degradation and potential system overload. Elevated memory usage, CPU utilization, disk I/O, network traffic, and request rates suggest a resource contention issue or a sudden surge in workload.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Resource Consumption:** Identify processes or applications consuming excessive resources using tools like `top`, `htop`, or monitoring dashboards.\n2. **Optimize Applications:** Review application code for performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations to reduce resource usage.\n3. **Scale Infrastructure:** If necessary, provision additional server instances or upgrade existing hardware to accommodate the increased workload.\n4. **Implement Load Balancing:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overloading any single instance.\n5. **Monitor System Health:** Continuously monitor system metrics and set up alerts to detect potential issues proactively."
