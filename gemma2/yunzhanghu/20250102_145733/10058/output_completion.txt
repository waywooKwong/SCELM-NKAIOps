	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "36.AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, 1.message, 2.getBackupEmp success, 37.computeOwnObjectIDs end, 38.computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a significant deviation from the expected behavior for several KPIs.  Specifically, 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a downward trend in mean and maximum values after the change. 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' also exhibit abnormal changes in their ranges and means. This suggests potential issues with authentication, data retrieval, or object processing.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' by analyzing related logs and system events. 2. Review the code and configuration related to 'message', 'getBackupEmp success', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' to identify potential bugs or inconsistencies. 3. Monitor the affected KPIs closely after implementing any changes to ensure that the anomalies are resolved."
