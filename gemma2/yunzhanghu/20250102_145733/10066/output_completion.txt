	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "[parseDataReportFlag ok, loadRegoMySQLInterval success, superiorAndDeputy empty, approve status error,  ],",
	"reason": "The output shows a significant increase in anomalies across various KPIs after the change.  Several key indicators like 'parseDataReportFlag ok' and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success' exhibit drastically reduced ranges, suggesting potential issues with data processing or resource availability. Additionally, KPIs like 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error' indicate potential problems within workflow processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes made to 'parseDataReportFlag ok' and 'loadRegoMySQLInterval success'**: Analyze log files and system metrics to pinpoint the root cause of the reduced data ranges. 2. **Review workflow processes affected by 'superiorAndDeputy empty' and 'approve status error'**: Look for bottlenecks or errors in the approval process and address any identified issues. 3.  **Implement monitoring strategies**: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) continuously to identify anomalies early and prevent widespread impact."
