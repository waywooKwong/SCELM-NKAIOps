	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(getBackupEmp success), sum(AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>), sum(computeOwnObjectIDs end), sum(message), sum(computeDeptInfo end)",
	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals a significant deviation in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the recent change. Specifically, KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'computeOwnObjectIDs end', 'message', and 'computeDeptInfo end'  show abnormal fluctuations exceeding established thresholds. This suggests that the implemented changes have negatively impacted these specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "A thorough investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. This involves examining the code changes introduced, reviewing logs for error messages or performance bottlenecks, and conducting further testing to isolate the affected components.  Once the source of the issue is identified, appropriate corrective actions can be taken, such as reverting problematic changes, implementing bug fixes, optimizing resource allocation, or refining the configuration settings."
