Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "",
	"reason": "All KPI values are within acceptable thresholds.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 



Let me explain the reasoning:

* **`change_type: "normal"`:** The provided data indicates that all KPIs are within expected ranges and haven't exceeded any defined thresholds. There's no evidence of abnormal behavior or a failure event.

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi": ""`:** Since there are no anomalies, this field remains empty.

* **`reason: "All KPI values are within acceptable thresholds."`:**  This clearly states the basis for the classification â€“ all measured metrics fall within normal operating parameters.

* **`solution: ""`:** A solution isn't necessary because there's no problem to solve. 




Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
