	"reason": "The provided metrics show significant deviations from expected behavior. Several KPIs, including 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message', exhibit unusual trends with high minimums and maximums. This suggests potential issues with data integrity or system performance.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. It's recommended to: \n1. Analyze logs related to affected KPIs.\n2. Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory) during periods of abnormal behavior.\n3. Review recent code changes that might have impacted these systems."
