	"reason": "The data analysis indicates a significant deviation from the expected patterns in several key performance indicators (KPIs). Notably, KPIs like AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, getBackupEmp success show increased volatility and negative trends. This suggests potential issues with authentication, object retrieval, or communication processes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these anomalies by examining logs, system configurations, and recent changes.  \n- For AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, review authentication mechanisms and user access controls. \n- For computeOwnObjectIDs end, analyze object storage performance and potential bottlenecks. \n- For message, troubleshoot communication channels and identify any latency or error issues. \n- For getBackupEmp success, investigate backup procedures and ensure successful completion."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the analysis reveals significant deviations from expected behavior in several KPIs.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The selection prioritizes KPIs with clear indicators of problems (e.g., AuthListByName, getBackupEmp success) and avoids repeating "build" KPIs as requested.  
* **reason:** Provides a concise explanation based on the observed trends in the KPIs, pointing to potential areas of concern.
* **solution:** Offers actionable steps to address the identified issues, focusing on investigation and root cause analysis for each affected area.
