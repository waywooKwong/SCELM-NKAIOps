	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end, message, sum(request latency) ",
	"reason": "The data indicates several key performance indicators (KPIs) are showing significant deviations from normal behavior. KPIs like 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' have negative trends in mean value, indicating potential issues with these processes.  Additionally, the 'message' KPI shows an upward trend, suggesting increased system load or communication overhead. ",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root causes of the performance degradation in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPIs:** This could involve analyzing logs, monitoring resource utilization, and examining code for bottlenecks. 2. **Optimize system resources:**  Identify and address any resource constraints that might be contributing to the performance issues, such as insufficient memory or CPU power. 3. **Fine-tune system configuration:** Review and adjust system parameters related to communication, caching, and thread management to improve efficiency. 4. **Implement load balancing:** Distribute workload across multiple servers to prevent overloading individual instances.  5. **Monitor system health continuously:**  Establish robust monitoring systems to track KPI performance and proactively identify potential issues."
