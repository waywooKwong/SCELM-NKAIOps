	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations from their normal ranges in several KPIs, indicating potential issues with system performance and data consistency. For example, KPIs like 'AuthListByName' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' exhibit larger fluctuations than usual, while 'message' shows a negative mean value after the change.  This suggests problems with authentication processes and data retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the affected systems and services to identify the root cause of these anomalies. Analyze logs, monitor system resources, and review recent code changes for potential issues. Consider rolling back any recent deployments if they are suspected as contributors to the problem."
