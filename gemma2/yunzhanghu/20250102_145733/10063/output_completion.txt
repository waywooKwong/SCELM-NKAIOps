	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "container_memory_rss, approve status error, superiorAndDeputy empty,  get logs,  parse logs",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from their normal ranges.  These include container memory usage, approval status errors, and issues with the 'superiorAndDeputy' metric. This suggests potential resource contention, process failures, or configuration problems.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Resource Contention:** Examine system logs and resource utilization metrics to identify if any processes are consuming excessive memory. 2. **Review Approval Process:** Analyze the approval status errors to pinpoint the specific stages causing issues. Address any bottlenecks or logic flaws in the approval workflow. 3. **Reconfigure 'superiorAndDeputy':**  Determine the intended behavior of the 'superiorAndDeputy' metric and adjust its configuration accordingly. If it's related to role assignments or permissions, ensure they are properly set up."
