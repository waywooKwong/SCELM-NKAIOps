	"reason": "Multiple KPIs show significant deviations from their expected ranges, indicating potential performance issues or system instability.  The increase in 'loaded_users' suggests a surge in traffic or resource contention. The anomalies in 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' point to problems with specific functionalities or authentication processes.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the increased 'loaded_users'. This could involve analyzing server logs, monitoring resource utilization, and identifying any bottlenecks in application code.\n2.  Debug the issues affecting 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'message' by examining relevant error logs and tracing the execution flow of these functionalities.\n3.  Monitor system performance metrics closely and implement appropriate scaling strategies to handle increased load. Consider adding more servers, optimizing database queries, or caching frequently accessed data."
