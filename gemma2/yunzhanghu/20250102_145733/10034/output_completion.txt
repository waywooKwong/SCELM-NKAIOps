	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "message, sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (response_code), AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, getBackupEmp success, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The provided metrics data show significant deviations from expected patterns. Several KPIs like 'message', 'sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (response_code)', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' exhibit unusual spikes or drops, indicating potential performance issues or system errors. Additionally, 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show negative trends, suggesting problems with specific functionalities.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in 'message', 'sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) by (response_code)', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' metrics. This may involve examining logs, monitoring system resources, and analyzing code behavior. 2. Identify the reasons behind the negative trends in 'getBackupEmp success' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'. Review relevant code, database queries, and external dependencies to pinpoint bottlenecks or failures. 3. Implement appropriate solutions based on the identified causes. This could involve optimizing code performance, resolving system errors, adjusting configurations, or addressing underlying infrastructure issues."
