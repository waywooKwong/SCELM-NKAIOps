	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit significant deviations after the change. KPIs like <:GIN:>, build <:*:> [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>, sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8, and getBackupEmp success show a shift in their ranges and trends, indicating potential issues with the implemented changes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced with the change to pinpoint the specific areas that might be affecting these KPIs. \n2. **Monitor resource utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage after the change to identify any resource bottlenecks or contention. \n3. **Analyze logs and error messages:** Examine system and application logs for any errors or warnings that could shed light on the cause of the performance degradation. \n4. **Revert the changes:** If the issues are severe, consider reverting the changes temporarily to restore the previous functionality while further investigation is conducted."
