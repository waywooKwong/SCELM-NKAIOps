	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly changed after the change.  This indicates a potential issue with the implementation or configuration. KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a drastic decrease in range, suggesting a potential decline in request processing or module performance.  'callback status error' and 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' also exhibit narrowed ranges, pointing to potential issues with error handling or backup operations. 'get metadata from header' shows a change in range, indicating a potential impact on data retrieval processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code changes made to identify the source of the data range shifts. Pay close attention to areas related to request handling, module management, error handling, and data retrieval. 2. **Monitor logs and error reports:** Analyze logs and error reports for any clues about the issues causing the data range changes. Look for patterns, timestamps, and specific error messages that can pinpoint the root cause. 3. **Revert the changes:** If the issue is severe and impacting critical functionality, consider reverting the changes to restore the previous state while investigating further. 4. **Test thoroughly:** After identifying and addressing the root cause, conduct thorough testing to ensure that the fix resolves the data range issues and does not introduce new problems."
