	"reason": "The system experienced a significant performance degradation after the change. Multiple KPIs related to disk I/O, system calls, and network traffic showed negative trends, indicating potential resource contention or increased load on the system. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made and identify the specific code or configurations that might be causing the increased disk I/O, system calls, and network traffic. Review logs and system monitoring data to pinpoint the source of the issue. Consider optimizing resource allocation, adjusting system configurations, or scaling up resources as needed."
