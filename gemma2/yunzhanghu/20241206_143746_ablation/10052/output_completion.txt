	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in the performance metrics after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' which dropped to 0, and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message', show substantial changes in their ranges and trends, suggesting potential issues with the system's functionality.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in the affected KPIs. Analyze the code changes introduced with the update and review logs for any errors or warnings. Consider reverting the changes or implementing a rollback strategy if the issues persist."
