	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "approve status error, irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",container=\"\",namespace=~\"jiesuan\",pod=~\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd\",metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"} [1m]) * 100, Response=<:MAP:>, no need or no have tags [trace.id=<:SEQ:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit significant deviations from their expected ranges after the change. This includes a notable increase in 'irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total)' suggesting potential resource contention.  Additionally, 'approve status error' and 'Response=<:MAP:>' show negative trends, indicating potential issues with processing and response times.  The 'no need or no have tags' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPIs also show anomalies, suggesting potential problems with data tagging and department information.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource usage:** Analyze the increased 'irate' values to identify resource-intensive processes and optimize their configurations. 2. **Debug 'approve status error':**  Examine logs and system configurations to pinpoint the root cause of the increased errors and implement necessary fixes. 3. **Monitor 'Response=<:MAP:>' closely:**  Identify bottlenecks in the processing pipeline and optimize for faster response times. 4. **Review data tagging practices:** Investigate the anomalies in 'no need or no have tags' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPIs to ensure accurate data tagging and department information. 5. **Roll back the change:** If the issues persist, consider rolling back the recent change to revert to the previous stable state."
