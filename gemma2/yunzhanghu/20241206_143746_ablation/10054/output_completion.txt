	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shifted significantly after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>', and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end'  show a narrowing range with a shift in mean, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or configuration issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following areas: \n1. **Policy Loading:** Examine the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI closely.  Check for errors in policy definitions, deployment issues, or resource constraints that might be preventing policies from loading correctly.\n2. **Department-Specific Issues:** Analyze the 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' KPI.  Determine if the change has introduced a dependency on a specific department or resource that is causing performance issues.\n3. **Backup and Authentication:** Review the 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' KPIs.  Look for any changes in authentication mechanisms or backup processes that might be contributing to the observed performance shifts.\n4. **Object ID Processing:** Investigate the 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' KPI.  Check for any changes in object ID management or processing logic that could be causing bottlenecks.\n5. **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) closely to identify any potential resource contention issues that might be impacting the affected KPIs."
