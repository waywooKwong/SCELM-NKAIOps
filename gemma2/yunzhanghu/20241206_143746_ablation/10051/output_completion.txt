	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shifted significantly after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating potential issues with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also exhibit changes in their minimum and maximum values, suggesting potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made that could have impacted these KPIs.  Review the code and configurations related to policy loading, object retrieval, backup operations, and authentication.  Monitor the affected systems closely and identify any error logs or performance bottlenecks.  Consider reverting the changes if they are identified as the root cause of the issues.  Additionally, explore potential solutions to address the identified performance bottlenecks."
