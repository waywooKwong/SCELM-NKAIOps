Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "96.kpi name: irate(node_netstat_Tcp_ActiveOpens{hostname=~"bj3-rd-ycard-prod-03"}[1m]), 97.kpi name: node_load5{hostname=~"bj1-rd-ycard-prod-01"}, 98.kpi name: increase(grpc_service_level_sli_result_duration_total{job=\"be/ycard\"}[2m]), 99.kpi name: CardQuery <:*:> channel, <:cardNo:> <:transactionID:> <:spanID:>, 102.kpi name: irate(node_disk_write_time_seconds_total{hostname=~"bj1-rd-ycard-prod-01"}[1m])",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) suggest a system failure.  Increased network activity (irate(node_netstat_Tcp_ActiveOpens)), elevated load on a node (node_load5), longer service level indicator (SLI) durations (increase(grpc_service_level_sli_result_duration_total)), and changes in CardQuery metrics indicate potential resource contention, performance degradation, or service disruptions.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of increased network activity:** Analyze network traffic patterns and identify potential bottlenecks or malicious activity. Consider optimizing network configurations or deploying load balancers. 2. **Monitor and manage node load:**  Implement resource monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify overloaded nodes. Consider scaling resources, optimizing applications, or adjusting system configurations to reduce load. 3. **Analyze SLI duration increases:**  Investigate the specific services experiencing longer durations.  Identify performance bottlenecks, optimize code, or adjust service level agreements (SLAs) as needed. 4. **Review CardQuery metrics:** Analyze the changes in CardQuery metrics to pinpoint specific issues related to card transactions. Investigate database performance, API response times, or application logic for potential bottlenecks. 5. **Monitor disk write activity:**  Investigate the reasons for increased disk write activity.  Optimize database queries, reduce log file sizes, or consider using faster storage solutions. "
