	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeOwnObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to a constant 0, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end' show increased variance and deviations from previous trends, indicating potential instability or errors in these processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue:**  Determine why policy loading has stopped and implement a fix. This could involve checking policy files, permissions, or underlying system configurations. 2. **Analyze the anomalies in 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' and 'computeOwnObjectIDs end':**  Review logs and system metrics to pinpoint the root cause of these deviations.  3. **Monitor the situation closely:** Track the KPIs after implementing solutions to ensure the changes have the desired effect and prevent further issues."
