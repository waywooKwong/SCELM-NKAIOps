	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit unusual trends and significant changes in their ranges after the change. This suggests the implemented change may have introduced unforeseen negative impacts on the system's performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes:** Thoroughly review the code and configuration changes made to pinpoint the source of the anomalies.\n2. **Monitor affected KPIs:** Continuously monitor the KPIs mentioned above to track their behavior and identify any further deviations.\n3. **Rollback or revert changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state.\n4. **Implement mitigations:** Once the root cause is identified, develop and implement targeted solutions to address the performance issues and stabilize the system."
