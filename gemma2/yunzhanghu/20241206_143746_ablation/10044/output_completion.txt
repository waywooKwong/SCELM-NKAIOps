	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shifted significantly after the change.  Specifically, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>'  all show changes in both minimum and maximum values, suggesting potential problems with data processing or retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' by examining policy loading processes and logs.  Review the code and configurations related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify potential bugs or misconfigurations.  Monitor these KPIs closely and collect more detailed logs to pinpoint the exact source of the issues."
