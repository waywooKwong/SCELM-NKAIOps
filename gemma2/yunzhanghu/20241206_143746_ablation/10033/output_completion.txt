{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The data ranges of several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly shifted after the change. This indicates a potential issue with the implementation or configuration. KPIs like 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>','computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end','Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' show drastic reductions in minimum values and shifts in mean values, suggesting a negative impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications introduced with the change to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences affecting these KPIs. 2. **Monitor system logs:** Analyze logs for errors or warnings related to the affected KPIs and the time of the change implementation. 3. **Compare configurations:** Compare the configurations before and after the change to ensure no misconfigurations or unintended settings are causing the issues. 4. **Rollback the change:** If the impact is severe, consider rolling back the change to the previous stable state while investigating the root cause. 5. **Conduct further testing:** Perform thorough testing to identify the specific scenarios or workloads causing the negative impact on the affected KPIs."
