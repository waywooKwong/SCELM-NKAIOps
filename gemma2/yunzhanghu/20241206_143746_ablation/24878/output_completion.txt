	"reason": "The system experienced a significant decline in performance after the change, indicated by a wide range of anomalies across various key performance indicators (KPIs).  Specifically, memory utilization increased, disk write rates fluctuated, and service level indicators (SLIs) for HTTP requests deteriorated. This suggests potential resource contention, disk I/O bottlenecks, or issues with the service itself.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource usage:** Analyze resource consumption patterns for affected nodes, focusing on CPU, memory, and disk I/O. Identify potential bottlenecks and consider scaling resources if necessary.\n2. **Review log files:** Examine system and application logs for any errors or warnings related to the changed component or services impacted by the anomalies.\n3. **Monitor service performance:** Continuously track SLIs and other relevant metrics to identify trends and potential recurring issues. Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of significant deviations.\n4. **Rollback or revert changes:** If the anomalies are severe and cannot be quickly resolved, consider reverting the recent changes to restore the previous stable state."
