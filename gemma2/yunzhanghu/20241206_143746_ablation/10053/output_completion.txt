	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "GIN, loaded policy count, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from their previous trends, indicating potential issues.  'GIN' exhibits a large upward shift in mean and a narrowed range, suggesting a possible change in system behavior. 'loaded policy count' drops to a constant 0, indicating a potential policy loading failure. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show negative mean shifts and range narrowing, hinting at performance degradation. 'getBackupEmp success' also shows a negative mean shift and range narrowing, possibly affecting backup operations.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'GIN' and 'loaded policy count'.  Analyze logs and system metrics related to policy loading and deployment.  Monitor the performance of 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' to identify bottlenecks or resource constraints.  Review the backup process and address any issues identified in 'getBackupEmp success'."
