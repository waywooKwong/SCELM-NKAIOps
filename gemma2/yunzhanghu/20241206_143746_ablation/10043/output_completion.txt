	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several KPIs have shifted significantly after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' shows a drastic reduction in range, indicating a potential issue with policy loading. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' show increased ranges and changes in trend, suggesting potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' issue to determine the cause of the reduced range. Analyze the increased ranges and trend changes in the other KPIs to identify the root causes and implement appropriate solutions. This may involve reviewing code changes, monitoring system resources, and conducting performance testing."
