Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  drops to a range of [0.0, 0.0], indicating a potential issue with policy loading.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' show upward trends in their means, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or resource contention.

	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the policy loading issue ('loaded policy count:<:NUM:>') and ensure policies are being applied correctly.

Monitor network traffic closely ('sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{prometheus=\"monitoring-cce-bj4-dev-01\",namespace=~"jiesuan", pod=~"yid-k8s-aiops-81-5778cb86bf-tmvfd", node=\"10.200.65.114\", metrics_path=\"/metrics/cadvisor\"}[1m])) by (pod,namespace,node) * 8') and optimize if necessary. Review the backup process ('getBackupEmp success') and address any potential issues causing changes in its performance."
