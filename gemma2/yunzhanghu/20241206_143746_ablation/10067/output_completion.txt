	"reason": "The system experienced a significant performance degradation after the change, indicated by a decrease in the overall trend and a narrowing of the data range for several key performance indicators (KPIs). This suggests that the change may have introduced bugs or inefficiencies in the system.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes**: Carefully examine the code changes made to identify potential issues that could be causing the performance degradation. 2. **Monitor system logs**: Analyze system logs for any errors or warnings that may provide insights into the cause of the problem. 3. **Conduct performance testing**: Perform comprehensive performance testing to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. 4. **Rollback the change**: If the issue is severe, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous system state. 5. **Seek expert assistance**: If the problem persists, consult with experienced developers or system administrators for further assistance."
