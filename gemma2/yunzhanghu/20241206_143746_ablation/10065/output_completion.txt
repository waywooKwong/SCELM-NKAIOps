**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the provided data clearly indicates a negative impact on system performance after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  I've selected KPIs that show the most drastic changes and are indicative of performance issues:
    * `irate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total)`:  A significant increase in CPU usage.
    * `sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total))`:  A large spike in incoming network traffic.
    * `sum(rate(container_network_transmit_bytes_total))`:  A corresponding increase in outgoing network traffic.
    * `parseDataReportFlag ok`: A potential issue with data processing or reporting.
    * `getPermTagsAndValues <:*:>`:  Unusual fluctuations in this metric suggest a problem with permission handling or data retrieval. 
* **reason:** The data points to a performance regression after the change.  Increased CPU usage, network traffic, and unusual metric behavior suggest a problem with the implemented changes.
* **solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the problem through code review and monitoring.  Reverting the changes or implementing mitigation strategies are immediate steps to address the performance degradation.
