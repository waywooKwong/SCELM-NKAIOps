	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m])), <:list modules:>, getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>, get metadata from header, ClientEnvHandler is <:*:>",
	"reason": "The data ranges for several key performance indicators (KPIs) have significantly shifted after the change.  KPIs like 'sum(rate(std_requests_total{job=\"be/yid\",code=~\"4..\",environment=\"rc\", instance=\"yid-k8s-aiops-81-d7664fd98-xxn9b\"}[1m]))' and '<:list modules:>' show a drastic decrease in their maximum values and an overall downward trend, indicating potential issues with request handling and module performance. Similarly, KPIs like 'getBackupEm<:updateFanweiEmployee failed:>' and 'get metadata from header' exhibit a narrowing range, suggesting potential bottlenecks or errors in those specific processes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code changes made to identify potential issues that could be impacting the KPIs. 2. **Monitor logs and error reports:** Analyze logs and error reports for any clues about the root cause of the performance degradation. 3. **Stress test the system:** Conduct thorough stress tests to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement. 4. **Optimize database queries:** Review and optimize database queries to ensure efficient data retrieval. 5. **Scale resources:** If necessary, scale up resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to handle the increased workload."
