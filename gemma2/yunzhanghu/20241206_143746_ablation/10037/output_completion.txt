	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, message",
	"reason": "The provided data shows a significant shift in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Several KPIs, including 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end', exhibit drastic changes in their minimum and maximum values, suggesting potential issues with data processing or system behavior. The overall trend for many KPIs has also reversed, indicating a negative impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' KPI**: Analyze the reasons behind the sharp decrease in its minimum value and the potential impact on system functionality. 2. **Review changes related to 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end'**: Identify any modifications that might have caused the increased range and reversed trend. 3. **Monitor 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'message' KPIs**: Track their performance closely and investigate any further deviations from expected behavior. 4. **Rollback recent changes**: If possible, revert the changes that were implemented to see if the anomalies disappear. 5. **Implement comprehensive testing**: Before deploying any future changes, ensure thorough testing to identify and mitigate potential performance impacts."
