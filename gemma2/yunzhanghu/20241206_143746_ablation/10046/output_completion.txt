	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant shifts in their data ranges after the change.  'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>'  went from a wide range to a very narrow range of 0. 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' and 'Depts only have yunzhanghu'  experienced changes in both minimum and maximum values, indicating potential issues with data processing or retrieval. 'getBackupEmp success' and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' also show altered ranges, suggesting potential problems with authentication or data access.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the source of these anomalies. Review logs and monitor system performance around the time of the change.  Consider reverting the changes if they are causing detrimental effects.  If the changes are necessary, explore alternative implementations or fine-tuning parameters to mitigate the observed issues."
