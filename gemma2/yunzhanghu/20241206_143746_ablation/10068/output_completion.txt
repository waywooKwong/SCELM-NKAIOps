	"reason": "The system experienced a significant performance degradation after the change. Multiple KPIs, including those related to network traffic, database performance, and resource utilization, showed sharp declines. This indicates a potential issue with the code change impacting system stability and efficiency.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes**: Carefully analyze the code modifications introduced during the change to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences. 2. **Monitor system logs**: Examine system logs for error messages or warnings that might provide clues about the root cause of the issue. 3. **Revert the change**: If possible, revert the recent changes and test the system to confirm if the performance degradation is resolved. 4. **Incremental testing**: Implement a phased rollout approach, gradually deploying the changes to a smaller subset of users to identify and isolate the problematic components. 5. **Performance tuning**: Optimize the affected code sections to improve efficiency and resource utilization."
