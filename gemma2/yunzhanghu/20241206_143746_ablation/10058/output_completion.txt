	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations in their ranges and trends after the change.  Specifically, KPIs related to network performance (36) and resource utilization (29, 30, 34) exhibit notable increases or decreases, suggesting potential issues with resource allocation or network congestion.",
	"solution": "Investigate the following: \n1. Analyze the changes made to the system and identify potential impacts on resource consumption and network traffic.\n2.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the provided KPI data indicates significant shifts in metrics after the change, suggesting a potential problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  
    *  I've excluded KPIs named "build" as per your instruction. 
    *  The selected KPIs represent a diverse set of areas affected (performance, resource utilization, network traffic).
* **reason:** The analysis highlights the key issues:
    *  **Network Performance:** KPI 36 shows a significant change in network receive bytes, indicating potential congestion or changes in network usage patterns.
    * **Resource Utilization:** KPIs 29, 30, and 34 all demonstrate shifts in resource consumption, suggesting potential resource contention or inefficient allocation.
* **solution:** The suggested steps provide a structured approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Identify the Root Cause:** Analyze recent changes to pinpoint their impact on the system.
    * **Continuous Monitoring:** Keep a close eye on the affected KPIs to understand if the situation stabilizes or worsens.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory) and network configurations to improve performance and prevent future issues.
