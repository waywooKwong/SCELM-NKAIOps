	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "loaded policy count:<:NUM:>, Depts only have yunzhanghu, getBackupEmp success, AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>, computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Notably, 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' dropped to zero, suggesting a potential issue with policy loading.  'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' all show downward trends, indicating problems with department management, backup operations, and authentication processes.  'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' also shows a change in trend, potentially affecting object retrieval.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the zero 'loaded policy count:<:NUM:>' and address any policy loading issues. Analyze the downward trends in 'Depts only have yunzhanghu', 'getBackupEmp success', and 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' to identify and rectify problems in department management, backup operations, and authentication.  Monitor 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' closely and ensure its functionality is not compromised."
