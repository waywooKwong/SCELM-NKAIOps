	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  We observe a decline in overall performance, particularly in metrics related to service requests, approval processes, and resource utilization. This suggests potential issues with the implemented changes impacting the system's stability and efficiency.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications introduced after the change to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences. 2. **Monitor affected services:** Closely track the performance of services impacted by the change, focusing on metrics like request latency, error rates, and resource consumption. 3. **Roll back the changes:** If the issue persists, consider reverting the changes to the previous state to restore functionality and stability. 4. **Incremental deployment:** Implement changes in smaller increments to allow for quicker identification and resolution of problems. 5. **Thorough testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing before deploying changes to production to minimize the risk of unforeseen issues."
