	"reason": "The provided data indicates a significant shift in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like 'loaded policy count' and 'computeDeptMembersObjectIDs end' show drastic reductions in range, suggesting potential issues with data loading or processing. 'Depts only have yunzhanghu' and 'getBackupEmp success' exhibit upward trends but with wider ranges, indicating instability. 'AuthListByName <:<:ChineseInfo:>:>' shows a downward trend in range, possibly affecting authentication processes. These anomalies collectively point towards a potential failure.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes implemented and their impact on data pipelines and processes. Analyze logs and system metrics to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the changes if they are deemed detrimental or implementing mitigation strategies to address the identified issues."
