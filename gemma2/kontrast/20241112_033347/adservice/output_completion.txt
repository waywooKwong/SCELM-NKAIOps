**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The chosen KPIs reflect the most impactful deviations:
    * **'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate':** These indicate problems with service communication and request handling.
    * **'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage':**  Increased resource consumption points to potential bottlenecks or inefficient code.
    * **'net_recv_packet':**  A wider range suggests network instability or increased traffic.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed KPI changes and their potential implications.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review and log analysis. It also proposes temporary solutions to alleviate immediate issues.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs).  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show a notable increase in negative values, indicating potential issues with request processing. 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage'  decreased, suggesting resource utilization might be too low or inefficient. 'net_recv_packet' also decreased, implying a reduction in network traffic reception.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to the 'adservice' to identify the root cause of these KPI deviations. Review logs for errors or warnings related to network communication, resource allocation, and service requests. Consider reverting the change or implementing targeted fixes to restore normal KPI values."

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show a dramatic increase in duration and a decrease in success rate, indicating potential service instability. 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' also show increased values, suggesting resource contention. 'net_send_packet'  shows a slight increase, which could be related to the other issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased resource consumption and service instability. Review recent code changes and configuration updates. Monitor system logs and error messages for clues. Consider scaling resources or optimizing code performance."
