**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the implementation.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The provided data highlights these KPIs as the most impacted:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic decrease suggests issues with communication or processing within the Istio service mesh.
    * `diskio`:  While the overall trend is upward, the change in range indicates potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory consumption could indicate inefficient memory management or resource contention.
    * `net_send_packet`: A significant increase might point to excessive network traffic or data transfer issues.
    * `istio_duration`: Longer request durations within Istio suggest performance degradation in service routing or communication. 
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the software change introduced problems affecting system performance, reliability, and efficiency.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Tracing back the code changes to pinpoint the exact source of the problem.
    * **Log Review:** Examining logs for error messages or patterns that might shed light on the issue.
    * **Rollback:**  If possible, reverting the change to restore previous functionality while further investigation is conducted.
    * **Corrective Measures:** Implementing fixes to address the identified issues and optimize system performance.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs).  'istio_success_rate' dropped to 0, indicating potential communication issues. 'diskio', 'memory_usage', 'net_send_packet', and 'istio_duration'  show increased variability and in some cases, extreme values, suggesting resource contention or processing bottlenecks.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  These KPIs were chosen because they represent core system functions and their anomalies directly point to potential problems:
    * **'istio_success_rate':**  A drop to 0% indicates a severe communication breakdown within the system.
    * **'diskio', 'memory_usage', 'net_send_packet':** Increased variability and extreme values suggest resource contention or inefficient usage.
    * **'istio_duration':**  Increased duration for requests points to processing delays, potentially caused by the software changes.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the change introduced issues based on the KPI data.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Identify the root cause:** Analyze the software changes to pinpoint the specific modifications that likely caused the issues.
    * **Review logs:**  Look for error messages, warnings, or performance-related events that occurred around the time of the change.
    * **Consider rollback:** If the issues are severe, rolling back the change might be the quickest way to restore stability.
    * **Implement mitigations:** If a rollback is not feasible, focus on addressing the resource constraints or inefficiencies introduced by the change.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, istio_duration, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs). istio_success_rate dropped sharply, diskio showed a sudden increase, memory_usage and istio_duration both experienced significant fluctuations, and net_send_packet saw a wider range of values. These anomalies indicate a negative impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the specific changes implemented to identify the root cause of these anomalies. Review logs and system configurations to pinpoint potential issues. Consider rolling back the change or implementing corrective measures to stabilize the affected KPIs."

{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, istio_duration, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change. istio_success_rate dropped drastically, diskio showed a sharp increase, memory_usage spiked, istio_duration increased significantly, and net_recv_packet exhibited a wider range of values. These changes indicate a negative impact on system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to identify the root cause of the KPI deviations. Review logs and system monitoring data to pinpoint the exact point of failure. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing temporary mitigation strategies to stabilize the system while a permanent solution is developed."

	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change. istio_success_rate dropped drastically, diskio, memory_usage, istio_duration, and net_send_packet  show abnormal increases or decreases, indicating potential performance issues and system instability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes implemented during this period.  Review logs for error messages or unusual patterns around the time of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing a temporary fix to restore system stability. Further analysis of the newly generated log pattern might provide additional insights into the root cause."

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, cpu_usage, and net_send_packet.  These KPIs show a decline in performance and stability after the change, indicating a potential failure.",
