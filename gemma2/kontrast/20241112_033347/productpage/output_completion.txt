Expected Software Changes

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that there are no significant anomalies in the KPIs after the change. The request_success_rate and request_count remain within historical norms, and there are no reported errors or performance degradations. The SCWARN algorithm also did not identify any anomalies.",

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count,  ",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates a change in the system's performance. KPIs like 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' show significant deviations from their pre-change trends. This suggests the implemented changes negatively impacted the system's ability to handle requests successfully.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Investigate the 'newly generated log pattern':** Analyze the new log pattern to understand its potential impact on system behavior. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the anomalous KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations."

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant deviation in key performance indicators.  The 'request_success_rate' KPI exhibits a sudden increase after the change, indicating potential issues with request processing or system stability.  Similarly, the 'request_count' KPI shows a decrease after the change, which could suggest a reduction in user activity or a problem with service accessibility. The 'SCWARN' algorithm also identified anomalies at specific timestamps, further supporting the conclusion that the change negatively impacted system performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Thoroughly review the code modifications introduced during the change to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. \n2. **Analyze system logs:** Examine logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the observed performance degradation. \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' KPIs to identify any further fluctuations or trends. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting service availability, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Implement gradual changes:** To minimize the risk of widespread issues, implement changes in smaller increments and thoroughly test each step before proceeding."

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count,  ",
	"reason": "The data shows a significant shift in the 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' KPIs after the change. The 'request_success_rate' trend shifted from down to up, while 'request_count' trend shifted from down to up. This indicates a potential issue with the implemented changes, leading to unexpected behavior in these critical metrics.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects related to request handling and success rates. \n2. **Analyze logs before and after the change:** Investigate system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI deviations. \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continue tracking the performance of 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' to identify patterns or further deviations. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Conduct further investigation:** If the root cause remains unclear, engage in deeper analysis, potentially involving profiling tools or expert consultation."
