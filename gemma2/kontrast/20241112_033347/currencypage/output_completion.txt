	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.  'request_duration' exhibited a drastic shift in its range, with values now reaching up to 13.4312, compared to a previous range of 0.0. Similarly, 'request_count' experienced a change in its range and trend, indicating potential issues with request processing.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the recent code changes:** Carefully review the modifications made before the data shift to identify potential bugs, configuration errors, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Analyze system logs:** Examine logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI anomalies. \n3. **Compare pre- and post-change metrics:** Conduct a detailed comparison of KPIs before and after the change to pinpoint the exact time and magnitude of the deviations. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and respond to future anomalies."
