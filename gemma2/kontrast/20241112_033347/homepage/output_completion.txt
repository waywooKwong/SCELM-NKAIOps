	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as request_success_rate and request_count. The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration. The overall trend for request_success_rate has shifted from upward to downward, while request_count has shifted from a downward trend to an upward trend. This suggests that the change has negatively impacted the system's performance and stability.",
