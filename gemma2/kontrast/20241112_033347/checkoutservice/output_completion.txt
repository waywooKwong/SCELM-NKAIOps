	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, istio_success_rate, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_count' showed a substantial increase, 'istio_success_rate' dropped dramatically, and 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet' experienced large fluctuations. Additionally, 'istio_duration' showed an unexpected upward trend. These anomalies suggest the change negatively impacted system performance and communication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the specific changes made to the 'Traffic Switch' and identify the root cause of the KPI deviations.  Review logs and system configurations to pinpoint the source of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the change or implementing mitigating measures to restore normal system behavior."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_recv_packet, istio_success_rate, diskio, istio_count, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The system experienced significant performance degradation after the change. Key metrics such as `net_recv_packet`, `istio_success_rate`, `diskio`, `istio_count`, and `cpu_usage` show notable deviations from their historical norms. This indicates potential issues with network communication, service reliability, and resource utilization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the source of the performance degradation. Review logs for error messages or unusual patterns. Monitor resource consumption closely and consider scaling resources if necessary.  Analyze the impact of the `newly generated log pattern` and determine if it's contributing to the issues."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_recv_packet, istio_success_rate, istio_count, diskio, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators.  net_recv_packet and istio_success_rate showed sharp decreases, indicating potential communication issues or service failures. istio_count also decreased, suggesting a reduction in service requests being processed.  diskio showed a sharp decrease, potentially indicating a problem with disk access or storage. cpu_usage also showed a change in trend, suggesting increased resource utilization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased performance in net_recv_packet and istio_success_rate. Review logs and system configurations related to network connectivity and service communication. Analyze the impact of the change on disk access patterns and optimize storage performance if necessary. Monitor CPU usage closely and adjust resource allocation if needed."
