**Explanation:**

The analysis reveals a clear pattern of KPI degradation following the change.  Here's a breakdown:

* **net_recv_packet & net_send_packet:** These KPIs, related to network traffic, show a decrease in values, suggesting potential issues with data transfer or communication.
* **memory_usage & cpu_usage:**  The increase in these KPIs indicates the system is working harder, potentially due to inefficiencies introduced by the change.
* **diskio:**  The sharp decrease in disk I/O indicates a significant reduction in disk activity, which could be a symptom of a problem with data access or storage.

These combined anomalies strongly point to a "failure" classification. The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation to pinpoint the root cause and implement corrective actions.
