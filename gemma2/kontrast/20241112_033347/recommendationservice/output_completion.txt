Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, net_send_packet, istio_success_rate, diskio, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Several key KPIs exhibit abnormal trends, indicating potential service degradation.  'istio_count' shows a steady decrease followed by spikes, suggesting intermittent connectivity issues. 'net_send_packet' demonstrates a steady decrease, pointing to reduced network throughput. 'istio_success_rate' drops significantly, indicating failed requests. 'diskio' and 'cpu_usage' also show concerning shifts, hinting at resource contention.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate network connectivity:** Analyze logs and network performance metrics to identify the root cause of the 'istio_count' fluctuations and 'net_send_packet' decrease. 2. **Review service logs:** Examine logs for errors and exceptions related to 'istio_success_rate' drops. 3. **Monitor resource utilization:**  Continuously track 'diskio' and 'cpu_usage' to identify bottlenecks and implement resource optimization strategies. 4. **Implement load balancing:** Distribute traffic effectively to prevent overload on specific resources. 5. **Conduct performance testing:**  Simulate realistic workloads to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement."

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, istio_duration, diskio, cpu_usage, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Several key KPIs show significant deviations from normal patterns.  'istio_count' and 'istio_duration' exhibit sustained increases and decreases, suggesting potential issues with service communication or resource utilization. 'diskio' and 'cpu_usage' also show abnormal trends, indicating potential resource contention. 'net_send_packet'  shows an unusual increase, potentially related to network traffic spikes.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the 'istio_count' and 'istio_duration' anomalies:** Analyze service logs and monitoring data to identify bottlenecks or performance issues within the recommendation service. 2. **Monitor resource utilization closely:**  Keep an eye on 'diskio' and 'cpu_usage' to ensure they remain within acceptable limits. Consider scaling resources if necessary. 3. **Analyze network traffic patterns:** Investigate the cause of the increased 'net_send_packet' traffic. This could be due to increased user activity or a change in service behavior. 4. **Implement logging and alerting:** Set up detailed logs and alerts for these critical KPIs to proactively detect future anomalies."
}
``` 


**Explanation of the Response:**

* **`change_type`**: Set to "failure" because the analysis reveals several KPIs deviating from normal patterns, indicating a potential problem.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**: Lists the top 5 KPIs with significant anomalies, excluding any KPIs named with 'build'.
* **`reason`**: Provides a detailed explanation of the observed anomalies and their potential implications.
* **`solution`**: Offers actionable steps to address the identified issues, focusing on investigation, resource management, network analysis, and proactive monitoring.

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "The provided KPI data indicates a significant performance degradation after the change.  Several KPIs, including 'istio_success_rate', 'diskio', 'istio_count', 'net_send_packet', and 'net_recv_packet', show negative trends with reduced ranges and/or increased negative values. This suggests potential issues with service reliability, resource utilization, or network performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the changes made:** Review the code and configuration changes implemented around the time of the data shift. 2. **Monitor resource consumption:** Closely track CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify potential bottlenecks or resource contention. 3. **Analyze network traffic:** Examine network logs and metrics to pinpoint any abnormal patterns or congestion points. 4. **Test and debug:**  Conduct thorough testing to isolate the root cause of the performance issues. 5. **Roll back changes:** If the issue is severe, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore previous functionality while further investigation is conducted."
