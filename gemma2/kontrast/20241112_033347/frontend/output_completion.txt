``` 


Let me explain the reasoning behind the classification:

* **Failure Change:** The analysis clearly shows that several KPIs have experienced abnormal increases and fluctuations after the change. This suggests a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs listed as "Top 5 abnormal" are directly related to network traffic (net_recv_packet, net_send_packet), service communication (istio_count, istio_success_rate), and resource utilization (memory_usage).  Their abnormal behavior points to potential issues in these areas.
* **Reason:** The significant changes in these KPIs indicate that the recent update likely introduced bugs or inefficiencies that are affecting the system's ability to handle network requests, communicate effectively between services, and manage memory resources.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation to pinpoint the source of the problem. This could include:
    * **Code Review:** Examining the code changes made during the update to identify potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinizing system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that might shed light on the issue.
    * **Monitoring Data:** Analyzing system monitoring data (e.g., CPU usage, disk I/O) to identify any bottlenecks or resource constraints that could be exacerbating the problem.
    * **Rollback:** If the issue is severe, consider rolling back the changes to a previous stable state while investigating the problem further.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  net_recv_packet, istio_count, and istio_success_rate show substantial increases, while net_send_packet and istio_duration exhibit unexpected shifts in their ranges. This suggests the change negatively impacted system performance and communication.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The chosen KPIs demonstrate the most significant changes, indicating a widespread impact.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the substantial increases in `net_recv_packet`, `istio_count`, and `istio_success_rate`,  suggesting potential issues with network traffic handling and Istio integration. The shifts in `net_send_packet` and `istio_duration` further point to disruptions in communication patterns.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the code changes, examining logs for clues, and potentially reverting the changes or implementing a gradual rollout to minimize disruption.
