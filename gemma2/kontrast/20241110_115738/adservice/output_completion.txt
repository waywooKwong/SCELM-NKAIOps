**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The most affected KPIs are:
    * **istio_duration:** Increased latency, suggesting issues with service communication.
    * **istio_success_rate:** Decreased success rate, indicating problems with service requests.
    * **cpu_usage:** While trending up, the increase might indicate the system is working harder due to the change.
    * **memory_usage:** Increased memory usage, potentially causing resource constraints.
    * **net_recv_packet:** Decreased network packet reception, suggesting issues with data flow.
* **Reason:** The metrics clearly show a negative impact on system performance after the change. The decreased success rates, increased latency, and changes in resource usage all point to a problem introduced by the change.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution is a combination of troubleshooting and recovery:
    * **Investigation:**  Carefully analyze the implemented changes to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Rollback:** If the problem is severe, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous stable state.
    * **Monitoring:** Closely monitor the system after any fixes are implemented to ensure performance returns to normal and the issue is resolved.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most significant changes are:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency, suggesting slower processing.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased success rate, indicating more failures.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory consumption, potentially leading to resource contention.
    * `net_send_packet`: Decreased network sending, possibly affecting data transfer.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Decreased network receiving, potentially impacting data ingestion. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests that the software change introduced problems. Increased latency, failures, and resource usage are all symptoms of a potentially faulty change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic investigation to pinpoint the source of the problem and then take appropriate corrective actions, such as reverting the change or implementing workarounds.
