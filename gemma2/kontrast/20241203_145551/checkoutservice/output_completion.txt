**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs stayed within expected ranges and there were no significant performance drops or anomalies detected.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Empty because there were no abnormal KPIs identified.
* **Reason:** The provided data shows that the KPIs  (cpu_usage, istio_count, diskio, istio_duration, net_recv_packet, istio_success_rate, net_send_packet)  did not show any drastic changes or exceed thresholds after the change.
* **Solution:** Not applicable since the change was classified as "normal".

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs).  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' showed large fluctuations, 'istio_count' decreased, and 'diskio' became consistently low. These indicate potential issues with communication, data processing, and resource utilization.",

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Not Applicable",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPI values remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations suggesting system performance degradation.  The analysis shows that the indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal.",
	"solution": "Not Applicable"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis clearly states that the indicator data does not exceed the threshold, indicating a normal change.  There are no significant deviations in KPIs to suggest a failure.

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations suggesting disruptions or performance degradation.  The 'SCWARN' algorithm also identified anomalies, but these are not directly linked to a failure based on the provided context.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal"  because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no significant performance issues.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A"  because there are no KPIs that are significantly abnormal.
* **Reason:** The analysis shows that the KPIs remained within acceptable ranges before and after the change.  While there are anomalies detected by the 'SCWARN' algorithm, the provided context doesn't explicitly link these anomalies to a failure. 
* **Solution:** "N/A" because there is no failure to address. 



Let me know if you have any other data points or context that might change this classification!
