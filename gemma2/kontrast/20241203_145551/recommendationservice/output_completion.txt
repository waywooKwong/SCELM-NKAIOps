**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most drastic changes are selected.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed KPI deviations and their implications for service performance.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution includes a structured approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the changes for potential bugs or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Look for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns in the logs.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the change to restore the previous state.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement temporary measures to minimize the impact of the issue while a permanent fix is developed.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_count, net_recv_packet, cpu_usage, diskio",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) exhibit abnormal behavior after the change.  'istio_duration' shows fluctuations, spikes, and a level shift down, indicating potential issues with request processing. 'istio_count' experiences a level shift up, suggesting a possible increase in request volume or load. 'net_recv_packet'  shows a sudden increase,  pointing to a surge in network traffic. 'cpu_usage' drops significantly,  which could be a sign of underutilization or resource constraints. 'diskio' also shows a decrease, potentially indicating a reduced workload or I/O activity. These combined anomalies suggest a significant disruption in the service's normal operation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased network traffic ('net_recv_packet') and request volume ('istio_count'). Analyze the 'cpu_usage' and 'diskio' drops to determine if they are due to reduced workload or resource bottlenecks. Review the 'istio_duration' fluctuations and spikes to identify potential performance bottlenecks in request processing. Consider scaling resources, optimizing code, or addressing underlying infrastructure issues to restore normal service operation."
