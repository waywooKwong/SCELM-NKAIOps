{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_success_rate, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show decreased performance, 'memory_usage' and 'net_recv_packet' have increased ranges, and 'istio_count' while increasing, indicates a potential issue with the overall system load.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate'. Analyze the memory and network usage patterns to identify potential bottlenecks. Review the 'istio_count' increase to understand if it's due to legitimate traffic or a potential issue with the service."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative impacts after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **'istio_duration'**: Increased, indicating slower request processing times.
    * **'istio_success_rate'**: Decreased, suggesting a higher rate of failed requests.
    * **'memory_usage'**: Increased range, implying potential memory pressure.
    * **'net_recv_packet'**: Increased range, indicating potentially higher network load.
    * **'istio_count'**: Increased, which could be a sign of increased traffic or a potential issue with the service.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to a significant performance degradation after the change. The increased latency, decreased success rate, and higher memory and network usage suggest a problem that needs to be addressed.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic investigation to pinpoint the root cause of the issues.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs represent the most significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly indicates a decline in service performance (istio_duration, istio_success_rate), potential resource bottlenecks (cpu_usage, memory_usage), and a reduction in network activity (net_recv_packet).
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting the identified issues by:
    * Investigating the root cause of resource contention and reduced network activity.
    * Reviewing recent changes to configurations and logs for clues.
    * Optimizing resource allocation and network settings to restore normal service performance.

	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations in system performance after the change.  The 'SCWARN algorithm' identifies anomalies, but the data itself doesn't reflect a failure.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there's no indication of system degradation.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no KPIs identified as significantly abnormal.
* **reason:** The analysis focuses on the absence of significant KPI deviations and the lack of evidence for system failure.
* **solution:**  "N/A" because no failures were identified.
