	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis clearly states that the KPIs did not exceed thresholds and showed no significant deviations after the change. This aligns with the criteria for a "normal" change.  Therefore, there's no need to list abnormal KPIs or suggest solutions.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" -  The analysis shows no significant KPI deviations or anomalies, suggesting the change did not negatively impact the system.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" -  Since the change type is "normal," there are no abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The data clearly indicates that KPIs like `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `diskio`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`  maintained their expected ranges and trends. The absence of anomalies further supports the classification as "normal."
* **Solution:** "N/A" -  No solution is required as the change did not cause any issues.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The most impactful KPIs showing abnormal behavior are:
    * `memory_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `istio_count`:  Increased, suggesting potential issues with service mesh communication.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, indicating longer service mesh call durations.
    * `net_send_packet`: While showing a slight increase, it contributes to the overall network performance degradation.

* **Reason:** The increased resource consumption and network activity point to a potential performance bottleneck introduced by the change. 

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on debugging the code changes and optimizing resource utilization.

**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that the KPIs (net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage, diskio, istio_count, istio_duration) show changes but not significant deviations that would classify the change as a failure. 

* **No Exceeding Thresholds:** The data states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal."
* **Within Historical Norms:**  The analysis mentions KPIs "remain within historical norms."

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant deviations in multiple KPIs point towards a system failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The selected KPIs represent the most impactful changes:
    * **`net_recv_packet` and `net_send_packet`:**  Decreased values suggest network communication problems.
    * **`istio_duration`:** Decreased values indicate potential issues with service mesh performance, which could be impacting communication between services.
    * **`memory_usage` and `diskio`:**  Shifted ranges suggest resource contention, which can lead to performance bottlenecks.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the changes have resulted in a performance degradation, citing the specific KPI deviations as evidence.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the code changes and analyzing system logs to identify the root cause of the performance issues. It also mentions potential solutions like reverting changes or applying patches.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The data shows no significant performance degradation or unusual behavior in the KPIs.  
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Not applicable because the change is classified as "normal".
* **Reason:** While anomalies were detected, the KPIs themselves haven't crossed thresholds indicating a failure. More context is needed to understand the significance of the anomalies flagged by SCWARN.
* **Solution:** Not applicable since the change is not classified as a failure.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, diskio, istio_duration, memory_usage, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change. CPU usage decreased sharply, disk I/O dropped to near zero, and memory usage increased.  Network reception packets also showed a change in trend. These indicate potential issues with system resource utilization and network performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the CPU usage and disk I/O drops. Review resource allocation settings and ensure sufficient resources are available to the service. Analyze the change logs and configuration files to identify potential issues related to network performance and memory consumption. Consider reverting the change or implementing mitigating measures to restore normal system behavior."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPI changes are significant and point to potential issues. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five KPIs with the most concerning changes are:
    * **cpu_usage:** A sharp decrease indicates the service might not be utilizing its allocated resources effectively or there could be a bottleneck elsewhere.
    * **diskio:**  A near-zero value suggests potential issues with disk access or configuration.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased duration for Istio requests could indicate network latency or problems with service mesh configuration.
    * **memory_usage:**  Increased memory usage could point to memory leaks or inefficient code.
    * **net_recv_packet:** A change in trend for network reception packets might indicate network connectivity issues or changes in traffic patterns.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests that the change introduced problems with system resource utilization, network performance, and potentially memory management.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific cause of the issues.
    * **Resource Management:**  Reviewing resource allocation and ensuring sufficient resources are available.
    * **Configuration Review:**  Checking for potential issues in service configurations, network settings, and Istio setup.
    * **Change Reversal or Mitigation:**  Depending on the analysis, either reverting the change or implementing measures to address the problems.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "Failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The analysis highlights memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_count, istio_duration, and net_recv_packet as the most concerning. These KPIs indicate potential resource issues and impacts on service communication.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to increased variability and potential strain on system resources. The changes in Istio metrics suggest that service communication might be affected.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the source of the increased memory and CPU usage.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Scaling resources or optimizing application code to handle the load.
    * **Network Performance:** Analyzing Istio metrics to understand and address any communication bottlenecks.
