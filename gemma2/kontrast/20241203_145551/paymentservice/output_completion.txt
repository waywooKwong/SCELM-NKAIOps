	"solution": "N/A"

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "Normal" because the KPIs remain within historical norms and there's no evidence of system degradation.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** N/A, as there were no significant deviations in KPIs.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that the single spike anomalies in CPU usage were transient and recovered to normal. Other key performance indicators remained stable, indicating the change didn't negatively impact system performance.
* **Solution:** N/A, as no issues were identified.

}
``` 


Let me break down why this classification was made:

* **No KPI Exceeding Threshold:** The analysis states that all indicator data is within the threshold, meaning no KPIs are showing abnormal values.
* **Stable KPIs:**  The data shows that KPIs like `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `istio_success_rate`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`  have relatively stable ranges before and after the change. While there are some shifts in the ranges, they don't indicate a significant negative impact.
* **Absence of Anomaly Detection:** The monitoring system didn't identify any anomalies, suggesting the change didn't cause any unexpected behavior patterns.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" because the KPIs remain within expected ranges and there's no evidence of system degradation.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  "N/A" because there were no significant KPI deviations.
* **Reason:** The analysis focuses on the fact that despite anomalies detected by the SCWARN algorithm, the KPI changes don't point to a failure. The ranges are within expected bounds.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no failure was identified.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because several KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs are experiencing the most drastic changes, suggesting they are central to the performance issues.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the abnormal increases and decreases in key performance indicators, pointing to a potential failure.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the changes made to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Log and Monitoring Analysis:**  Deep dive into logs and system monitoring data to gain a clearer understanding of the behavior.
    * **Reversal or Mitigation:** Depending on the findings, consider reverting the changes or implementing strategies to address the performance problems.
