**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the provided data does not indicate a significant failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A"  Since the change type is "normal", there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The analysis points out anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm, but the overall KPI data remains within historical norms. There are no indications of a significant performance degradation or system instability.
* **Solution:** "N/A"  No solution is needed as the change is not classified as a failure.
