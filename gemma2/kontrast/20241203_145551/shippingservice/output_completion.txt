```
Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPI values remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations in system performance.  The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, but these are not indicative of a failure as they don't correspond to a breach of established thresholds.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no significant performance degradations.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  "N/A" because there are no KPIs exceeding thresholds that would classify this as a failure.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights that while anomalies were detected, they don't translate to a failure scenario based on the provided data.
* **solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified requiring a solution.
