``` 


Let me explain the reasoning behind the classification:

* **Failure Change:** The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This suggests the change introduced issues rather than improvements.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five KPIs listed are the most significantly impacted:
    * **'istio_duration':** Increased latency, indicating slower service response times.
    * **'istio_success_rate':** Decreased success rate, meaning more requests are failing.
    * **'cpu_usage':**  Shifted usage patterns, possibly indicating resource contention.
    * **'memory_usage':**  Similar to CPU usage, suggests potential memory pressure.
    * **'net_recv_packet':**  Decreased packet reception, pointing to network problems.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a systemic issue, likely stemming from the code changes. The negative trends across various performance aspects strongly indicate a failure.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on diagnosing the root cause and mitigating the negative impact:
    * **Code Review:** Analyze the changes to pinpoint the source of the problems.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine system logs for error messages or unusual activity.
    * **Rollback:** Consider reverting the change if the impact is severe and a quick fix isn't readily available.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory) and network configurations to improve performance.

Review recent changes made to the service, monitor resource utilization closely, and analyze logs for error messages or performance bottlenecks. Consider scaling resources or optimizing service configurations to alleviate the issues."
}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Failure Classification:** The KPIs  "istio_duration," "istio_success_rate," "cpu_usage," "memory_usage," and "net_send_packet" all show significant deviations from their pre-change behavior. This points to a failure as the change negatively impacted system performance.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the KPIs that exhibit the most drastic changes, suggesting they are the primary drivers of the failure.

* **Reasoning:** The combination of increased duration and decreased success rate for "istio_duration" and "istio_success_rate" strongly indicates a problem with service request handling.  The increased "cpu_usage" and "memory_usage" suggest the system is struggling to handle the load, potentially due to inefficient code or resource constraints. The slight increase in "net_send_packet" could indicate network traffic is also affected.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the performance issues. This involves:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Examining recent changes, logs, and system configurations to pinpoint the source of the problem.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring resource utilization to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.
    * **Performance Tuning:**  Implementing code optimizations, configuration adjustments, or scaling strategies to improve system performance.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show increased variability and decreased success rates, while 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' indicate higher resource consumption.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes post-change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The five most concerning KPIs are listed, focusing on those directly related to service performance and resource usage.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed deviations in KPIs and their implications for service performance and resource consumption.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution outlines a systematic approach to troubleshooting the issue, including identifying the root cause, reviewing configurations, and considering potential remedies like reverting the change or implementing optimizations.
