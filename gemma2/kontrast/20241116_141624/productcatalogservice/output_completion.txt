	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations or degradations in system performance.  The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, but these are not necessarily indicative of a failed change. Further investigation into the anomaly types and their context is needed.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  We classify this as "normal" because the KPI data doesn't show a clear pattern of failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Since there's no evidence of a failure, we mark this as "N/A".
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while anomalies were detected, the KPIs themselves haven't crossed thresholds indicating a system failure. 
* **Solution:**  Because it's not a failure, a solution isn't required. Further analysis of the anomalies might be beneficial to understand if they are benign or require attention.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration",
	"reason": "The changes resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators. Memory usage decreased, CPU usage increased, and istio_duration spiked, indicating potential resource contention and increased processing load.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased CPU usage and memory fluctuations. Analyze the impact of the change on system resource allocation and optimize resource utilization. Review the istio_duration spikes to identify bottlenecks or inefficient communication patterns."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "memory_usage", "cpu_usage", and "istio_duration" are the most concerning as they directly relate to system performance and resource utilization.
* **Reason:** The decrease in memory usage and the increase in CPU usage suggest potential resource contention.  The spike in "istio_duration" indicates potential communication bottlenecks within the system. These changes could lead to performance degradation and instability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issues and implementing optimizations.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  Classified as "failure" due to the significant KPI deviations.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The selected KPIs highlight resource usage (memory, CPU), network activity (net_recv_packet), and potential issues within the Istio service mesh (istio_count, istio_duration).
* **Reason:** The increased volatility and potential resource contention in memory, CPU, and network metrics suggest a problem. The unusual Istio activity points to possible issues within the service mesh itself.
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions aim to address the root causes by:
    * **Resource Management:** Ensuring the service has adequate resources.
    * **Istio Troubleshooting:**  Identifying and resolving issues within the Istio service mesh.
    * **Network Optimization:**  Improving network performance and efficiency.
    * **Continuous Monitoring:**  Implementing proactive monitoring to prevent future issues.

**Explanation:**

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs demonstrate the most significant deviations:
    * **memory_usage:** Decreased, suggesting potential memory pressure.
    * **cpu_usage:** Increased, indicating a possible resource bottleneck.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased with a larger range,  likely pointing to network latency issues or increased Istio workload.
    * **istio_count:** Increased,  suggesting more requests are being routed through Istio.
    * **diskio:** Increased,  indicating potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
* **Reason:** The combined changes in these KPIs strongly suggest that the change introduced performance issues.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on diagnosing and addressing the root causes of these performance problems. This involves:
    * **Resource Analysis:**  Determining if CPU and memory are being used efficiently.
    * **Network Optimization:** Examining Istio configuration and network traffic to improve performance.
    * **Disk I/O Tuning:**  Optimizing disk access patterns and storage configuration.
