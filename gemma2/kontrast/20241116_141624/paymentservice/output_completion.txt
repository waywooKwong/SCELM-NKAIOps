{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that KPIs remain within historical norms.

The newly generated log pattern requires further investigation but doesn't directly indicate a failure.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Normal" because the KPIs show no significant deviations from historical norms. The anomalies detected are temporary and recover to normal.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** N/A  (Not applicable since the change is classified as normal)
* **Reason:** The analysis points out that the KPIs, despite some anomalies, remain within acceptable ranges. The anomalies are classified as "Recover to normal state," meaning they were temporary fluctuations and did not cause lasting negative impacts.
* **Solution:** N/A (No solution is required as the change is not classified as a failure)

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the provided KPIs show clear deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list prioritizes the KPIs with the most significant changes:
    * `diskio`:  A complete shift in the range suggests a potential issue with disk access.
    * `memory_usage`: A substantial increase could indicate memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * `istio_count`, `istio_duration`, `istio_success_rate`:  These KPIs related to Istio, a service mesh, show concerning changes, potentially indicating problems with service communication or routing.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the unusual shifts in KPIs, particularly the `diskio` and `memory_usage` changes, which are often indicative of system performance degradation. The Istio-related KPIs suggest a problem within the service mesh itself.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes investigation and potential rollback:
    * **Investigate:** Analyze logs and system events around the anomaly timestamps to understand the sequence of events leading to the changes.
    * **Rollback:** If the impact is severe, rolling back the change is a quick way to restore stability while further investigation is conducted.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `net_send_packet`:  A sudden increase suggests potential network congestion or increased data transfer.
    * `diskio`:  A rise in disk I/O could indicate database issues or excessive file system activity.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration for Istio requests points to potential latency problems within the service mesh.
    * `cpu_usage`: Elevated CPU usage might be a sign of inefficient code or resource contention.
    * `memory_usage`:  Fluctuations in memory usage can lead to performance degradation and potential crashes.

* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced instability or increased the system's load, leading to performance degradation.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issue through code review and performance analysis. Optimizing resource utilization and implementing robust monitoring are crucial steps to prevent similar failures in the future.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The data shows no significant performance degradation or persistent anomalies. KPIs like `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `istio_success_rate`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`  demonstrate changes in range but remain within acceptable bounds.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** Since the change type is classified as "normal," there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The analysis suggests that the observed anomalies are likely temporary fluctuations and not indicative of a system failure. The absence of consistent negative trends in key performance indicators supports this conclusion.
* **Solution:**  No specific solution is required as the change appears to have had no detrimental impact on the system.

Optimize disk configurations and consider using faster storage solutions. 4. **Service Dependency Analysis:** Investigate the correlation between anomalies in istio_duration and other KPIs. Analyze dependencies between the payment service and other microservices to identify potential performance bottlenecks. 5. **Logging and Monitoring Enhancement:** Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions to capture detailed system events and performance metrics. This will aid in diagnosing the root cause of anomalies and facilitating faster issue resolution."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, and istio_duration all showed abnormal increases or decreases in their values, indicating potential disruptions in system performance. The SCWARN algorithm also flagged anomalies at specific timestamps, further supporting the classification as a failure.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in the affected KPIs. Review the implementation details of the change and compare them to the pre-change system configuration. Analyze the logs and system events around the timestamps of the anomalies. Consider reverting the change or implementing mitigating measures to restore system stability."
