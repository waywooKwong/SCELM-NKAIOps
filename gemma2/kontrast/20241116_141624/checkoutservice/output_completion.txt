{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, istio_count, cpu_usage, diskio",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant performance degradation.  Key indicators like 'istio_success_rate' dropped sharply, 'net_send_packet' and 'istio_count'  showed unusual fluctuations, 'cpu_usage' decreased unexpectedly, and 'diskio'  became consistently low. These indicate potential issues with service communication, resource utilization, and data access.",

Review logs and system configurations for any misconfigurations or errors. Consider rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigations to restore service stability."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly point to a failure. KPIs like 'istio_success_rate' plummeting and 'cpu_usage' decreasing unexpectedly are strong indicators of a problem.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The chosen KPIs represent a diverse set of issues:
    * **'istio_success_rate':** Indicates problems with service communication and requests failing.
    * **'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet':** Suggest issues with network communication and data transfer.
    * **'istio_count':** Might point to inefficient service invocation patterns or issues with the Istio proxy.
    * **'cpu_usage':** The unexpected decrease could signal a process not utilizing resources as expected, potentially due to a bug or misconfiguration.
    * **'diskio':** The consistently low disk I/O suggests potential issues with data access or storage. 

* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced bugs or misconfigurations that are disrupting the service's normal operation. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identifying the exact code changes responsible for the problems.
    * **Log and Configuration Review:** Examining logs and configurations for errors or misconfigurations that might explain the issues.
    * **Rollback or Mitigations:**  Reverting the change if possible or implementing temporary fixes to restore service stability while a permanent solution is developed.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs, despite anomalies, don't show significant deviations that would indicate a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there's no clear indication of KPIs primarily responsible for a failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis emphasizes that while anomalies exist, the overall system performance remains within acceptable ranges. The downward trends in some KPIs require further investigation to determine their cause and potential impact.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because there's no immediate need for a solution based on the current data. Further investigation into the anomalies and their potential causes is recommended.

	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates no significant deviations in KPIs after the change. All KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no indications of system disruptions or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Normal" because the KPIs show no significant deviations or anomalies after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  N/A because there are no abnormal KPIs identified.
* **Reason:** The analysis of the provided KPI data reveals that all key metrics stayed within expected ranges. There were no sudden increases, decreases, or unusual fluctuations that would suggest a failure.
* **Solution:** N/A as no issues were detected. 




Let me know if you have any other data sets you'd like me to analyze!
