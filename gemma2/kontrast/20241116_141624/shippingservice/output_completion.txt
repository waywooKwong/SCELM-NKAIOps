	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "Normal" because the KPIs, while showing some fluctuations, do not exhibit significant deviations from historical norms. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** N/A because there are no KPIs that show a clear pattern of failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights fluctuations in KPIs like `istio_success_rate`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `istio_duration`, and `net_recv_packet`. However, these fluctuations don't consistently point to a system degradation or failure. 
* **Solution:** N/A because no significant failures were identified. Continuous monitoring and further investigation of the anomalies might be beneficial to understand the underlying causes of the fluctuations.
