``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" 
   The analysis states that KPIs remain within historical norms, indicating the change did not negatively impact system performance.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** "N/A" 
   Since the change type is "normal," there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.

* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that despite anomalies detected, the KPIs haven't significantly deviated from expected ranges. This suggests the change didn't cause a major failure.

* **Solution:**  "N/A" 
   As the change isn't classified as a failure, no solution is required.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on several KPIs after the change. This points to a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selection focuses on KPIs showing the most significant deviations:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp decrease indicates problems with communication or task completion within the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_count`: Increased variability suggests inconsistent behavior or potential resource contention within Istio.
    * `net_send_packet`:  Increased range indicates potential network issues or changes in data transfer patterns.
    * `memory_usage`:  Lower usage could be a symptom of a process not functioning as expected, or it might indicate a memory leak.
    * `istio_duration`: A wider range suggests that requests are taking longer to process, impacting overall system responsiveness.
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced problems affecting the system's communication, resource utilization, and overall performance.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach:
    * **Identify the Root Cause:** Analyze the code changes made during the period to find the specific source of the issues.
    * **Gather More Data:** Examine system logs and performance metrics for more detailed insights into the problems.
    * **Consider Rollback:** If the impact is severe, rolling back the change might be the quickest way to restore stability.
    * **Implement Corrective Measures:** If a rollback is not feasible, develop and implement solutions to address the identified issues.

* **Solution:**  "N/A" 
    * As there's no failure, no solution is required.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  \n* istio_success_rate dropped drastically, indicating communication issues within the Istio service mesh.\n* istio_duration increased, suggesting latency problems in service calls.\n* cpu_usage and memory_usage saw upward trends, pointing to potential resource contention.\n* net_send_packet also increased, implying higher network traffic possibly due to failed requests.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five KPIs with the most concerning deviations are:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop indicates problems with communication within the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency in service calls suggests performance issues.
    * `cpu_usage`:  An upward trend points to potential resource contention.
    * `memory_usage`: Similar to CPU usage, an increase suggests resource pressure.
    * `net_send_packet`:  Higher network traffic might be a result of failed requests or increased communication attempts.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a cascade of issues triggered by the change. Communication failures within the Istio mesh lead to latency, resource contention, and potentially more network traffic as services try to recover.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the performance degradation. This might involve:
    * Debugging the Istio configuration and service mesh.
    * Analyzing resource usage patterns to optimize resource allocation.
    * Investigating network traffic to pinpoint bottlenecks.
    * Considering a rollback of the change if the issues are severe and difficult to resolve.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list prioritizes KPIs with the most drastic changes:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp drop indicates potential communication issues within the service mesh.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs listed are the ones that show the most drastic and concerning deviations, pointing to the core areas of the system affected by the change.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the direct correlation between the change and the observed performance degradation.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the changes made to pinpoint the root cause.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Analyze CPU and memory usage to identify potential bottlenecks.
    * **Rollback/Fixes:**  Consider reverting the change if it's causing widespread issues or implement targeted fixes to address the specific problems.

```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Not Applicable",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPI values remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations or anomalies detected. The overall trend suggests stability.",
	"solution": "Not Applicable"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that the KPIs remain within acceptable ranges and there are no significant deviations or anomalies. 

* **SCWARN Algorithm:**  While the SCWARN algorithm identifies anomalies, the data provided doesn't specify the nature or severity of these anomalies. Without further context, we can't determine if they are significant enough to classify the change as a failure.
* **KPI Ranges:** The data shows that KPI ranges have expanded slightly after the change, but this doesn't necessarily indicate a negative impact. It could be due to normal fluctuations or changes in system load.
* **Trends:** The overall trends for most KPIs are either upward or stable, suggesting continued functionality.


Let me know if you have more details about the SCWARN anomalies or specific thresholds for these KPIs. This would help in providing a more definitive classification.

```
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_count, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Significant deviations observed in key KPIs after the change.  'istio_success_rate'  dropped sharply, 'istio_count' and 'net_recv_packet' showed unexpected increases, 'net_send_packet'  also increased, and 'cpu_usage'  decreased. These indicate potential issues with service communication, network traffic, and resource utilization.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'istio_success_rate' drop:** Analyze the logs and metrics related to Istio to pinpoint the cause of the decrease. This could involve checking for configuration errors, network connectivity issues, or problems with the Istio service mesh itself. 2. **Monitor and analyze the increased 'istio_count' and 'net_recv_packet'**: Determine if this increase is due to legitimate traffic or a potential surge in requests. If it's a surge, investigate the cause and consider scaling resources accordingly. If it's abnormal traffic, implement security measures to mitigate the issue. 3. **Review the 'net_send_packet' increase:** Analyze the application's behavior and network traffic patterns to understand the reason for the increased data transmission. 4. **Monitor 'cpu_usage' closely:** While a slight decrease might not be immediately concerning, continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure that the system has sufficient resources. If 'cpu_usage' remains low, investigate potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the application."

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, memory_usage, net_send_packet, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "A significant drop in `istio_success_rate` and `istio_duration` indicates potential issues with service communication and latency.  The `memory_usage` also shows a downward trend, which could point to memory leaks or inefficient resource utilization. While `net_send_packet` and `cpu_usage` show slight changes, the overall pattern suggests a negative impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the cause of the `istio_success_rate` and `istio_duration` decrease. Analyze logs and system metrics to identify potential bottlenecks or errors in service communication. Review memory usage patterns and identify potential leaks. Optimize resource allocation and consider scaling resources if necessary."
