**Explanation:**

* **Pre-Approved Process Adherence:** This information is not provided in the dataset. 
* **Post-Change Metrics Comparison:** While the ranges of `request_duration` and `request_count` changed after the update, these changes are significant enough to be classified as failures.  They fall within expected operational bounds. 
* **Impact Assessment:**  The KPIs remain within historical norms, and there are no indications of a service disruption or performance degradation.

* **Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies:** The analysis states that there are no anomalies found.

``` 


**Explanation of Classification:**

The provided data points towards a "failure" classification due to the following reasons:

* **Deviated KPIs:** The metrics 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations after the change.  Increased request duration and altered request count patterns indicate potential performance problems.
* **Anomaly Description:** The mention of "Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" directly points to a human error causing a likely software defect. This strongly suggests a failure.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The drastic changes in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' clearly point to a failure.  The fact that these KPIs are essential for system performance (duration directly relates to user experience, and count indicates load) makes the impact significant.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** While only two KPIs are explicitly flagged, it's crucial to investigate *all* metrics related to 'currencypage' service to understand the full scope of the issue.

```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": null,
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations in system performance.  Additionally, the anomaly detection system did not flag any unusual patterns.",
	"solution": null
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

Based on the information provided, the change appears to be normal. Here's why:

* **No significant KPI deviations:** The metrics `request_duration` and `request_count` show fluctuations within expected ranges before and after the change. There are no major increases or decreases that would indicate a problem.
* **Anomaly detection:** The system didn't identify any anomalies during the analysis period. This suggests that the system behaved as expected after the change. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
