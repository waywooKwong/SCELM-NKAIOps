* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We list the three most concerning KPIs:  memory_usage, cpu_usage, and istio_duration. 
* **reason:** The provided data clearly indicates resource strain (memory & CPU) and potential network performance issues (istio_duration).
* **solution:** A structured approach to troubleshooting is recommended: code review for inefficiencies, resource optimization, and deeper investigation of Istio logs.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the provided data clearly shows significant increases in several crucial metrics after the change, indicating a potential performance degradation. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the KPIs that show the most drastic changes:
    *  `memory_usage`: Increased significantly.
    *  `cpu_usage`: Increased significantly.
    *  `istio_duration`: Increased significantly. This suggests issues with service mesh communication.
    * `istio_count`: Increased, pointing to more frequent service calls or potential routing problems within the Istio mesh.
    * `diskio`: Decreased. While this might seem positive, it's worth investigating if this is related to the change or a coincidence. 

* **Reason:** The  sharp increases in memory, CPU, and Istio-related metrics strongly suggest that the changes introduced a performance bottleneck or inefficiency.
* **Solution:** This focuses on troubleshooting and optimization:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the recent code changes for any potential causes of increased resource consumption.
    * **Logging & Error Analysis:** Look for error messages or warnings in application logs that might shed light on the issue.
    * **Profiling:** Use profiling tools to pinpoint specific parts of the code that are consuming excessive CPU or memory.
    * **Database Optimization:** Analyze database queries and optimize them for efficiency.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage,cpu_usage,diskio,istio_duration",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant shift after the change.  Memory usage decreased, CPU usage increased, disk I/O dropped to near zero, and istio_duration saw an increase in its maximum value. These changes suggest a potential performance issue or resource contention.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure**  The provided data indicates a clear deviation from expected behavior, suggesting a problem introduced by the change. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The most impactful anomalies are in `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `diskio`, and `istio_duration`.  While `memory_usage` decreased, it's often preferable to see consistent resource utilization. The spike in `cpu_usage` and the drastic drop in `diskio` are concerning as they could point to a bottleneck or inefficient usage.
* **reason:** The combination of these metrics points towards a potential performance issue.  Increased CPU usage coupled with reduced disk I/O suggests that the application might be waiting on other resources or facing inefficiencies in data access. 
* **solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes investigation and optimization:

    1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify why `cpu_usage` increased and why `diskio` dropped significantly. This could involve examining logs, profiling the application, and analyzing system resource usage.
    2. **Performance Tuning:** After understanding the root cause, adjust system parameters, application configurations, or even hardware resources to improve performance.

	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration, diskio, istio_count",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations after the change. Memory usage decreased, CPU usage increased, and  'istio_duration' experienced a large range increase. 'diskio' also showed an unusual spike in activity. Additionally, 'istio_count' saw an increase.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to identify the cause of these anomalies. Analyze resource consumption patterns and optimize resource allocation if necessary.  Monitor system logs for any errors or warnings related to the affected components. Consider rolling back the recent changes if the issue persists."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The observed data indicates a negative impact following the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  The selected KPIs show the most significant deviations, suggesting they are directly affected by the problematic change.
* **reason**: A clear explanation of the observed changes and their potential implications is provided.
* **solution**:  A structured approach to troubleshooting and resolving the issue is outlined. This includes investigating the code changes, analyzing resource usage, examining logs, and potentially rolling back the recent modifications.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_duration, memory_usage, diskio, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key metrics after the change indicate a potential failure. CPU usage dropped substantially, while istio_duration saw a sharp increase along with changes in memory and disk usage. These fluctuations suggest  performance issues or resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the altered CPU usage and resource consumption. Analyze logs and system performance data to pinpoint the source of the increased istio_duration and potential bottlenecks. Consider adjusting resource allocation or optimizing application code to address these issues."
