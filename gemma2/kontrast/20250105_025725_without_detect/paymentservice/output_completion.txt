}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure** - The observed KPI changes suggest a negative impact after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The most concerning KPIs are those showing substantial increases or decreases outside normal ranges. Memory usage, istio metrics (success rate, count, duration), and network I/O read rates are all significantly affected.
* **reason:** The combination of these KPI changes points to potential performance bottlenecks, resource contention, or code issues introduced by the recent change.  Increased memory usage and network traffic could indicate inefficient resource utilization.
* **solution:** A multi-pronged approach is needed:
    * **Code Review:** Carefully examine the recently modified code for any inefficiencies, database queries that might be slow, or unnecessary data processing.
    * **Performance Profiling:** Use profiling tools to pinpoint exactly where the performance degradation is occurring within the application.
    * **Resource Scaling:** If profiling reveals that certain resources (CPU, memory) are consistently overutilized, consider scaling up those resources.


Remember that this analysis is based on limited information. A thorough investigation involving logs, detailed code review, and potentially additional testing would be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure and implement a suitable solution.

	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased CPU and memory usage. Analyze logs and system resources to identify bottlenecks or resource contention. Review Istio configuration settings and network traffic patterns to understand the reasons behind the changes in istio_count and istio_duration.  Consider scaling up resources or optimizing application performance to address the issues."
