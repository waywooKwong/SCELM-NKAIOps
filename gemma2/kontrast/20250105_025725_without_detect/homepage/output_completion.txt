{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant drop in the 'request_success_rate' and a shift in the trend of 'request_count' from down to up. This suggests the change introduced defects causing failures in handling requests.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to request handling. Review logs for error messages and identify the specific issues causing the failure in processing requests. Once identified, implement corrective measures to fix the defects."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly indicate a deviation from normal behavior. A  drop in 'request_success_rate' to 0% signals that requests are failing consistently. The change in trend of 'request_count' also raises concerns.
* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** While the provided data focuses on "single kpi anomalies,"  "request_success_rate" and "request_count" are the primary indicators of failure. 
* **Reasoning:** The combination of a dropped success rate and a trend shift in request count strongly suggests that the change introduced bugs impacting request handling. This aligns with the initial input indicating "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes."

**Explanation:**

The provided metrics clearly point towards a failure:

* **`request_success_rate`:** A drop to 0% signifies that all requests are failing after the change. This is a critical indicator of a severe issue.
* **`request_count`:** While an increase in request count could be normal, the presence of negative values is highly unusual and suggests data corruption or incorrect calculations.


The analysis mentions "indicator data exceeding the threshold" and "newly generated log pattern," further supporting the classification as a failure.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No KPI Deviations:**  The provided metrics for `request_success_rate` and `request_count` show changes that fall within expected ranges. There are no drastic spikes or drops that would signal a problem.

* **Anomaly Detection is Absent:** The fact that there were zero anomalies detected by the system further supports the conclusion that the change did not introduce any unexpected behavior. 



Since the change adhered to established thresholds and didn't trigger any anomaly alerts, it's safe to classify it as "normal."

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in the 'request_success_rate' and a shift in the trend of 'request_count'.  This suggests that the software changes introduced defects causing failures in handling requests.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to request handling. Review logs for specific error messages or patterns that correlate with the decrease in success rate. Implement rigorous testing procedures to identify and rectify the defective code."
