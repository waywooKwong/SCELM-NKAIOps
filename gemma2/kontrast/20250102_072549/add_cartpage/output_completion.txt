**Explanation:**

The analysis focuses on identifying failures based on KPI deviations, anomaly detection patterns, and pre-approved process adherence. The input data shows:

* **No significant KPI deviations:**  There's no mention of KPIs exceeding thresholds or showing a drastic drop in performance.
* **Limited anomaly detection:** The 'SCWARN' algorithm flagged anomalies, but the description provided doesn't indicate a failure state. 
* **Data interpretation ambiguity:** While there's a change in data ranges for some KPIs, this could be within normal operational bounds.  

**Important Note:** This analysis relies heavily on the information provided. A deeper investigation might be needed if there were more concrete indications of failure (e.g., specific error codes, user complaints, or cascading effects).

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Normal:** The data indicates a lack of significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The analysis reports no anomalous KPIs.
* **Reason:**  While the ranges for 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' shifted, the absence of total anomalies and anomaly description shapes suggests these changes might be within normal operational fluctuations rather than indicators of a failure.

* **Solution:**  No solution is required as the change appears to have had no negative impact based on the available data.

	"solution": "" 
}
```


**Explanation:**

The analysis report states:

* **No significant KPIs deviations:**  The metrics show changes but not outside historical norms.
* **Total anomalies found: -1:** This negative value suggests that the anomaly detection system might have flagged a non-issue or is functioning incorrectly.
* **Total number of anomalous kpis: 0:** This confirms that no specific KPIs are identified as abnormal.

Given this, the change appears to be normal. Further investigation into the anomaly detection system's output and potential external factors influencing the metrics might be beneficial for gaining deeper insights.
