	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate",

"
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Focus on `request_success_rate`**: While `request_count` shows a similar trend, the complete failure indicated by `request_success_rate` dropping to 0 is a much stronger indicator of a problem. This suggests that even though requests are being received, they are not being processed successfully.

* **Potential Causes**: The sudden drop in `request_success_rate` could be due to various reasons:
    * A bug introduced in the recent code changes that's preventing successful request handling.
    * Misconfiguration of a service or dependency crucial for processing requests.
    * External factors like network issues or database outages impacting request completion.

* **Next Steps**: The suggested solution focuses on debugging and identifying the root cause of this failure.

	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The change resulted in anomalies in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.  Both KPIs show deviations from their historical trends. This indicates a potential disruption in the system's ability to process requests successfully.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact.\n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Carefully examine the modifications made before the data shift, looking for potential bugs, misconfigurations, or unintended side effects.\n3. **Analyze system logs:** Investigate logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI deviations.\n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the anomalous KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations."
