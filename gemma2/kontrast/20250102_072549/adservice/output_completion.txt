{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_usage, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "There is a significant deviation in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. istio_usage, cpu_usage, and memory_usage show increased values while net_send_packet and net_recv_packet show decreased values. This indicates potential resource contention or network issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the cause of the increased CPU and memory usage. Analyze network traffic patterns to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Optimize application code and resource allocation to minimize resource consumption."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure** - The data shows a clear negative impact after the change, warranting classification as a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We select KPIs with the most drastic changes: 
    * `istio_usage`:  Likely indicates problems with the Istio service mesh itself.
    * `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`:  Point to resource strain on the system.
    * `net_send_packet`, `net_recv_packet`: Suggest potential network issues hindering communication.
* **reason**: The explanation connects the abnormal KPIs, highlighting potential resource contention and network problems as root causes. 
* **solution**: Provides actionable steps: investigate resource usage, analyze network traffic, optimize application code and resource allocation.

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_usage, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "The changes in CPU usage, memory usage, and network packet metrics indicate a significant performance impact. The increase in 'istio_count' suggests a potential issue with the service mesh configuration.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased resource consumption by analyzing application logs, monitoring system processes, and reviewing recent changes to configurations. Optimize the service mesh settings and consider scaling resources if necessary."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  Set to "failure" because the metrics show a clear deviation from normal behavior. Increased CPU, memory, and network traffic often signal problems.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The most concerning indicators are:
    * `cpu_usage`: Significant rise in CPU utilization can lead to slowdowns and application instability.
    * `memory_usage`:  Increased memory consumption might indicate memory leaks or inefficient data handling.
    * `istio_count`: This suggests a potential issue with the service mesh itself, possibly due to increased traffic or misconfigurations. 
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`:  While these are not as critical as CPU/memory, their changes might be related to the issues with `istio_count`.

* **Reason:** The combined effect of these metrics points to a failure scenario. Resources are being consumed heavily, and there's a strong indication that the service mesh is struggling.
* **Solution:**  This response outlines actionable steps: 

    1. **Investigate:**  Dive deeper into logs and system processes to pinpoint the source of the problem.
    2. **Optimize:** Review Istio configurations for potential improvements.
    3. **Scale:** If necessary, increase server resources (CPU, memory) to handle the increased load.
