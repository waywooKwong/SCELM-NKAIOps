{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, diskio, istio_duration",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations from normal behavior. `istio_success_rate`  shows a sharp increase, while `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet` experience large fluctuations. `diskio` drops to near zero, indicating potential disk access issues. `istio_duration` also shows changes suggesting latency problems.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the metrics clearly indicate abnormal behavior that could be impacting the service's health.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are selected based on their significant deviations from expected ranges or trends. 
* **Reason:** The description explains the observed anomalies and how they point to potential problems (network issues, disk access problems, latency).
* **Solution:**  This outlines steps to investigate the root cause of the failures:

    * **Troubleshooting:** Analyze logs and system metrics to pinpoint the source of the anomalies.
    * **Configuration Review:** Check if any recent configuration changes might be contributing to the issues.
    * **Scaling:** If resource contention is suspected, consider scaling up infrastructure components.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant negative changes after the event. This strongly suggests a problem introduced by the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list includes KPIs that have drastically changed for the worse:
    * `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`: Network reception and transmission issues.
    * `istio_success_rate`:  Indicates failures in a service or communication protocol, likely due to the network problems.
    * `diskio`: A sudden drop suggests potential disk-related problems (full disk, permission errors, etc.).
    * `istio_duration`: While this KPI might be slightly up, it could be related to the other issues.

* **Reason:**  The provided data clearly points towards a failure caused by the change. The combination of network performance degradation and potential storage issues suggests a systemic problem that needs immediate attention.


* **Solution:**
    * The suggested steps focus on:
        * Identifying the root cause of the network problems.
        * Investigating the disk issue.
        * Closely monitoring `istio_duration` for any further signs of trouble.
        * Reviewing system logs and error messages for clues about what went wrong during the change process.

* **reason**: This provides a concise explanation of why these KPIs are considered failures, highlighting the specific issues observed.
* **solution**: The suggested steps are aimed at troubleshooting and resolving the identified problems:

    * Investigate the 'istio_success_rate' drop to find its cause.
    * Monitor disk usage for potential issues related to 'diskio'.
    * Analyze network performance metrics ('net_send_packet') for bottlenecks or errors.
    * Examine logs and traces for clues about the origin of the anomalies.

	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations after the change. istio_success_rate dropped drastically, net_send_packet and net_recv_packet  show large fluctuations, diskio usage became almost zero, and istio_duration saw a downward trend. These indicate potential issues with communication, resource utilization, or service performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in these metrics. This might involve examining logs, monitoring system resources, and reviewing recent code changes. Consider rolling back the change if it's determined to be the source of the problem."
}
``` 


Let me explain the reasoning behind this classification:

* **Significant Deviations:** The provided data clearly shows substantial drops or fluctuations in key metrics like `istio_success_rate`, `net_send_packet`, `net_recv_packet`, and `diskio`.  These are not typical "normal" variations.
* **Potential Impacts:** These changes suggest:
    * **Communication Issues:**  A drop in `istio_success_rate` indicates problems with service-to-service communication.
    * **Resource Contention:** Fluctuations in network metrics (`net_send_packet`, `net_recv_packet`) could point to resource contention or network bottlenecks.
    * **Disk I/O Anomaly:**  The near-zero `diskio` usage is unusual and might suggest a configuration problem or data access issue.

**Important Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided numerical data. A deeper investigation would require examining logs, system performance details, and potentially the code changes associated with the event.

	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' drops drastically, 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet' show reduced values, 'diskio' reaches zero, and 'istio_duration' increases, indicating potential issues with network communication, resource utilization, or service performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these KPI changes. Check for: \n- Network connectivity problems\n- Resource constraints (CPU, memory) on the affected services\n- Configuration errors related to the deployed changes\n- Logging and monitoring data for more specific insights into the issue."
