	"reason": "The provided data indicates that the change did not cause any significant deviations in KPIs.  All indicator data remained within established thresholds and no anomalous patterns were detected by the monitoring system.",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** The metrics presented show no substantial changes in key performance indicators like `request_success_rate` and `request_count`. While there are shifts in data ranges, they fall within expected operational fluctuations.  

* **Threshold Compliance:**  The statement "All indicator data does not exceed the threshold" is crucial. It implies that the monitoring system did not flag any critical alerts or breaches of pre-defined performance limits.
* **Absence of Anomalous Patterns:** The analysis mentions a total of 6 anomalies found, but only 1 anomalous KPI. This indicates that the identified anomalies are relatively minor and do not point to a widespread failure caused by the change.


Since there's no evidence of system degradation or abnormal behavior exceeding established thresholds, classifying this change as "normal" is appropriate based on the provided data.

The change resulted in a complete failure in successful requests ('request_success_rate' dropping to 0) and unpredictable fluctuations in 'request_count'. This points towards a serious issue within the homepage service.
