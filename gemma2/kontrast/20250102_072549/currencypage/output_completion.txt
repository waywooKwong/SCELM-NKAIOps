{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": null,
	"reason": "All indicator data falls within expected thresholds and there are no significant deviations in KPIs like request_duration or request_count. The change does not exhibit any patterns suggesting abnormal behavior.",
	"solution": null
}
``` 



Let me break down the reasoning behind this classification:

* **No Threshold Exceedances:** The provided data explicitly states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal." This means the system's core performance metrics are operating within acceptable limits.
* **Stable KPI Trends:** While there are changes in the ranges of `request_duration` and `request_count`, the overall trends described as "down" before change and "up" after change don't necessarily indicate a failure.  Systems often undergo natural fluctuations, and a shift in trend doesn't always signal a problem.
* **Absence of Anomalies:** The analysis states there are no anomalies found, confirming that the monitoring system hasn't detected any unexpected patterns or deviations from expected behavior.



Since the change adheres to these criteria, it's classified as "normal."

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The metrics clearly show a significant departure from normal behavior. The drastic increase in 'request_duration' range with negative values and the drop in 'request_count' suggest issues with request processing or counting.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  While there are only two clear anomalies, 'request_duration' and 'request_count', we list them as they are the primary indicators of failure. Other KPIs might have subtle changes that need further investigation.
* **Reason:** The increased 'request_duration' indicates slower response times, potentially impacting user experience. The decreased 'request_count' could point to issues with service availability or incorrect counting logic.

* **Solution:** The proposed solutions aim to:
    * Identify the root cause of the anomalies through code review, log analysis, and resource monitoring.
    *  Temporarily revert changes if the issue is deemed critical to minimize disruption.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided metrics clearly indicate a negative impact on system performance after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** "request_duration" and "request_count" are the primary culprits due to their significant changes in range and value, reflecting issues with latency and request processing.
* **Reason:**  The increased 'request_duration' suggests that requests are taking longer to be processed, potentially causing a sluggish user experience. The decreased 'request_count' might indicate problems with the service being able to handle requests effectively or potential errors preventing requests from completing successfully.
* **Solution:** A thorough investigation is needed to pinpoint the source of the problem. This might involve:
    * Reviewing the code changes made during the deployment.
    * Analyzing system logs and performance data around the time of the change.
    * Testing the affected functionality to reproduce the issues.

	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies.\n3. **Investigate 'Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' incident:** This specific incident might be directly related to the observed KPI changes. Analyze its impact on system behavior and configurations. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes. \n5. **Monitor KPIs closely:** Continue to monitor 'request_duration' and 'request_count' after implementing any solutions to ensure the issue is resolved."

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count",
	"reason": "The KPIs 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations after the change.  'request_duration' has a drastically increased maximum value and a negative mean, while 'request_count' has a reduced range and a negative mean. These indicate potential performance issues and service degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this update to identify the cause of these KPI fluctuations. Review logs for any error messages or unusual activity around the time of the change. Consider rolling back the recent changes or implementing temporary mitigation strategies while further analysis is conducted."

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided metrics clearly indicate a failure.  The `request_duration` and `request_count` KPIs both show abnormal behavior after the change, pointing to performance degradation. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** While there are only two majorly impacted KPIs, listing them as "request_duration, request_count" is sufficient for this analysis. 
* **Reason:** The significant increase in `request_duration` suggests that requests are taking much longer to process, potentially due to bottlenecks or inefficiencies introduced by the change.  The decreased range and negative mean of `request_count` indicate a reduced number of successful requests, further supporting the failure classification.
