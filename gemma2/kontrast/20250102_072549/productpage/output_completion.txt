``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided metrics indicate a clear deviation from expected behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** While only two KPIs are explicitly mentioned as abnormal,  the focus should be on understanding the "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" which likely caused this shift.
* **Reason:** The decrease in 'request_success_rate' suggests that a higher percentage of user requests are failing after the change. This, coupled with the increase in 'request_count,' implies that users might be retrying failed requests, potentially leading to further resource contention.  This supports the initial hypothesis about "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" being the root cause. 
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause:
    * **Code Review:** Carefully examine the code changes made during the 'Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes' period to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity patterns that might shed light on the problem.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: Classified as "normal" because the metrics remain within acceptable ranges and there are no indicators of significant performance degradation or system disruption.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  Empty, as no KPIs exhibited anomalies.
* **Reason**: The analysis highlights that all key performance indicators (KPIs) like request_success_rate and request_count stayed within their normal operational ranges before and after the change. There's no evidence of sudden increases, decreases, or shifts in these metrics, suggesting the change didn't negatively impact system performance.
* **Solution**: Since the change is deemed normal, no immediate solutions are required.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis shows a clear deviation from expected behavior:

* **`request_success_rate` Decreased:**  This suggests the software is failing to process requests successfully, leading to user frustration.

* **`request_count` Increased:** This indicates that even though requests are failing, clients might be retrying them frequently, further stressing the system.

These symptoms point towards a "failure" change, requiring immediate investigation and correction.

	"reason": "The metrics 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' show deviations from expected behavior after the change.

}
``` 




Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics "request_success_rate" decreasing and "request_count" increasing after the change point towards a failure. While the ranges remain similar, the trends indicate potential issues with the service handling requests correctly.  

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** I've listed the two most directly impacted KPIs: "request_success_rate" and "request_count". These provide the clearest picture of the performance degradation. 

* **Reasoning:** The combination of these metrics, coupled with the initial alert about "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes", strongly suggests a failure caused by the software change.  The decreased success rate implies the service is not processing requests as intended, possibly due to misconfigured IPs or faulty software logic.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific defective changes within the code related to IP addresses and software functionality. 
    * **Log Examination:**  Analyzing logs for detailed error messages that pinpoint the nature of the issues (e.g., connection errors, validation failures).
