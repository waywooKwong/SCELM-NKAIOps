Let me explain why:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`** - The data shows that KPIs are within expected ranges and there are no alarming trends.  

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "No KPIs identified as primarily responsible for anomalies."`** Since the overall system appears stable, there isn't a clear set of top KPIs driving anomalies.
* **`"reason"`**: The explanation emphasizes that the data doesn't point to a critical failure. While some individual anomalies exist, they are not widespread enough to signal a major problem.

* **`"solution"`**:  Because the situation is currently normal, no immediate solution is required. 


**Important Note:** It's always crucial to monitor systems and data continuously. While this analysis suggests normality based on the provided information, unexpected changes can occur.
