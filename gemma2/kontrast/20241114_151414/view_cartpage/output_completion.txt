	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant anomaly in the 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' KPIs. The 'request_count' shows a shift in its distribution and trend, while the 'request_success_rate' remains at 0.0, indicating potential issues with request processing and service availability.  The presence of 'Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies' further suggests a systemic problem caused by the recent change.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes**: Review the recent code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects that might be affecting request processing. \n2. **Analyze logs**: Examine system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the anomalies. \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs**: Continuously track the performance of the 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations. \n4. **Rollback the changes**: If the anomalies are severe and impacting service functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Conduct further analysis**: If the root cause remains unclear, engage in deeper analysis, potentially involving profiling tools or expert consultation."
