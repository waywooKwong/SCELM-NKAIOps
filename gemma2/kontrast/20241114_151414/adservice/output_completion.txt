Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped considerably, indicating potential issues with service requests.  'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' also decreased, suggesting resource underutilization which might be a symptom of the issue. 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet'  decreased, pointing to a potential reduction in network traffic.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased 'istio_success_rate'.  Review the service logs and monitor system resource utilization closely.  Consider optimizing network configurations to ensure efficient data transfer."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most dramatic changes are selected.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the key indicators of a failure:
    *  **Low 'istio_success_rate':** This strongly suggests problems with the service handling requests.
    *  **Decreased CPU and Memory Usage:**  While this might seem positive, it often indicates a problem if it's unexpected. It could mean the service is not being fully utilized, potentially due to errors.
    *  **Reduced Network Traffic:**  Less data being sent and received points to potential issues with service communication.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    *  **Root Cause Analysis:**  Finding the exact reason for the failed requests.
    *  **Resource Monitoring:** Keeping a close eye on system performance to identify any bottlenecks or unusual behavior.
    *  **Network Optimization:**  Ensuring efficient data flow between components.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change. istio_success_rate dropped drastically, indicating potential issues with service requests. CPU and memory usage also decreased, suggesting underutilization or inefficient resource allocation. Network metrics like net_recv_packet also showed a decline, pointing to potential communication problems.  istio_count  also decreased, indicating a potential reduction in service requests.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased istio_success_rate. Review resource allocation for CPU and memory to ensure optimal utilization. Analyze network traffic patterns to identify potential bottlenecks or communication issues. Monitor istio_count to understand the impact on service requests and adjust accordingly."

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show substantial increases and decreases respectively, indicating potential issues with service performance and reliability. 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' also exhibit increased ranges, suggesting resource contention. 'net_send_packet' shows a slight change in range, which could be related to the other anomalies.",
