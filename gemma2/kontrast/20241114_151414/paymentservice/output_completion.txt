	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'net_send_packet', 'diskio', 'memory_usage', 'istio_count', and 'istio_duration'  show  increased variability and shifted ranges compared to pre-change data. This suggests the change negatively impacted system performance and resource utilization.",
	"solution": "1. **Review change logs:**  Thoroughly examine the details of the implemented changes to identify the specific modifications that might be causing these performance issues. 2. **Resource Monitoring:**  Increase monitoring of system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to pinpoint the exact bottlenecks introduced by the change. 3. **Rollback or Remediation:** If possible, consider rolling back the change or implementing targeted fixes to address the identified performance problems. 4. **Performance Tuning:**  Optimize system configurations and settings to improve resource utilization and mitigate the negative impact of the change."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations and negative impacts on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased variability and a wider range of values.
    * `diskio`: Similar to `net_send_packet`, indicating potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `memory_usage`: A significant increase in the range of memory usage, suggesting increased memory pressure.
    * `istio_count`:  A wider range of values, indicating potential issues with Istio service mesh communication.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased variability in request durations, suggesting performance degradation within the Istio mesh. 
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the KPIs show significant deviations and shifted ranges compared to pre-change data, indicating a negative impact on system performance and resource utilization.
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions are a common approach to addressing performance issues after a change:
    * **Review and Debug:**  Understand the nature of the change to pinpoint the root cause.
    * **Monitor Closely:**  Track system resources to identify bottlenecks.
    * **Rollback/Remediation:** If possible, revert the change or apply fixes to address the issues.
    * **Performance Tuning:** Optimize system configurations to improve efficiency.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, and istio_duration show increased ranges and fluctuations, indicating potential resource contention or service instability.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations after the change, suggesting a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The listed KPIs demonstrate the most substantial changes in range and trend, indicating potential issues.
* **Reason:** The increased ranges and fluctuations in these KPIs point to potential resource contention, increased load on the system, or faulty code introduced by the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issues through code review and log analysis.  It also proposes temporary mitigation strategies like increasing resources to alleviate immediate pressure.
