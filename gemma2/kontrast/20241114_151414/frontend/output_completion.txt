**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because several KPIs show significant negative changes after the submission.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop indicates communication failures between services.
    * `istio_duration`: A significant increase suggests slowdowns in service interactions.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`: Wider ranges point to unstable network communication.
    * `istio_count`: Fluctuations imply inconsistent service calls.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests the change negatively impacted the service's communication and performance.
* **Solution:** The suggested steps involve troubleshooting the code changes, analyzing logs, and potentially reverting or fixing the problematic changes to restore normal KPI behavior.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests problems with service communication.
    * `istio_duration`: A significant increase indicates latency issues in service calls.
    * `net_send_packet`, `net_recv_packet`: Changes in their ranges point to potential network performance problems.
    * `memory_usage`: Unusual changes suggest the service might be consuming more memory than expected.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly indicates that the change introduced issues affecting service communication, network performance, and resource utilization.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * Identifying the root cause of the communication and latency problems.
    * Analyzing network logs and system resource usage to pinpoint the reasons behind the changes in network and memory usage.
    * Potentially rolling back the change or implementing corrective measures based on the identified issues.
