	"reason": "The KPIs net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, memory_usage, and istio_duration show significant deviations after the change.  net_recv_packet and net_send_packet indicate a decrease in network traffic, memory_usage shows a sharp drop, and istio_duration exhibits a significant increase in latency.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs indicate a clear negative impact on the service's performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The most concerning KPIs are `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, and `istio_duration`.  These show a decrease in network traffic, a significant drop in memory usage, and a substantial increase in latency.
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced a problem. The decrease in network traffic could indicate a failure in communication or a reduction in user activity. The drop in memory usage might point to a memory leak or a process not using allocated resources. The increased latency in `istio_duration` suggests a bottleneck or inefficiency in the service's communication or processing.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution is a multi-pronged approach:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Thoroughly investigate the logs, system resource usage, and the code changes made to pinpoint the exact cause of the anomalies.
    * **Rollback:** If the issue is severe and cannot be quickly resolved, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous stable state.
    * **Mitigation:** Once the root cause is identified, implement appropriate solutions to address the problem. This could involve fixing bugs, optimizing code, adjusting resource allocation, or modifying configurations.

{

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change. CPU usage decreased, disk I/O dropped to zero, and memory usage increased.

}
``` 


**Explanation of the Classification:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The observed KPI changes clearly indicate a negative impact on system performance. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **cpu_usage:** A decrease in CPU usage could indicate a problem with the application not utilizing resources effectively or a bottleneck elsewhere in the system.
    * **diskio:**  A drop to zero disk I/O suggests the application is not accessing disk data, which might be unexpected or indicate a problem with file systems or data access.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased istio duration implies delays in communication between services, potentially caused by misconfigurations or increased load on the service mesh.
    * **memory_usage:** Increased memory usage can lead to performance degradation and even crashes if the system runs out of memory.
    * **net_recv_packet:** An increase in network reception packets could indicate the application is receiving more data than expected, potentially overloading the network or system resources.

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs suggests a significant disruption in the expected system behavior. The decreased CPU usage alongside increased memory and network traffic points to potential resource contention or inefficiencies introduced by the change.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the performance issues through code review, log analysis, and system monitoring.

CPU usage and disk IO show a sharp decrease, while memory usage, net_recv_packet, and istio_duration exhibit abnormal increases. These anomalies indicate a potential disruption in system performance and resource utilization.",

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs). CPU usage decreased, memory usage also decreased, diskio decreased, and net_send_packet decreased.  These changes, coupled with the identified anomalies by the SCWARN algorithm, suggest the change negatively impacted system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the KPI changes. Review the change logs and deployment details to pinpoint the source of the issue. Consider rolling back the change or implementing corrective measures to restore normal system performance. Monitor the KPIs closely after implementing any solutions."
