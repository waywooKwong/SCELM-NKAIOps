{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, cpu_usage, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, 'diskio' showed an unexpected increase, and 'memory_usage', 'cpu_usage', and 'net_send_packet'  exhibited unusual fluctuations. These changes indicate a potential system instability and performance degradation.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:**  Review the code changes made during the deployment to identify potential causes for the KPI anomalies. 2. **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) closely to identify any bottlenecks or resource contention issues. 3. **Network Performance Analysis:** Analyze network traffic patterns and performance metrics to rule out network-related issues. 4. **Logging and Debugging:**  Enable detailed logging and debugging to capture system events and pinpoint the source of the anomalies. 5. **Rollback or Remediation:** If the cause is identified, consider rolling back the changes or implementing corrective measures to restore system stability."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests problems with service communication.
    * `diskio`: An unexpected increase could indicate excessive disk write operations.
    * `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`:  Fluctuations point to potential resource contention.
    * `net_send_packet`: Unusual fluctuations might signal network issues.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests a failure in the system's performance and stability after the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested steps provide a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve the failure.

'istio_success_rate' dropped sharply, 'istio_duration' increased substantially, and 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' showed wider ranges. Additionally, 'diskio' experienced a reduction in its range, potentially indicating resource contention. These anomalies suggest the change negatively impacted system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications made during the change process to pinpoint the root cause of the performance degradation. 2. **Monitor resource utilization:** Closely monitor system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O to identify any bottlenecks or resource starvation issues. 3. **Optimize network communication:** Analyze network traffic patterns and optimize network configurations to improve the efficiency of data transfer. 4. **Roll back the change:** If the issue persists, consider rolling back the change to the previous stable state while further investigation and remediation efforts are underway."

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on system performance after the change.  
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were most affected, indicating core functionality issues:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp decline suggests problems with communication or service invocation within the system.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency points to performance bottlenecks or delays in processing requests.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`:  Large fluctuations in network traffic could indicate misconfigurations or network congestion.
    * `memory_usage`:  A spike in memory consumption might signal inefficient code or resource leaks.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs indicates a systemic failure rather than isolated issues. The change likely introduced bugs or misconfigurations that are disrupting normal system behavior.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging and remediation:
    * **Code Review:**  Carefully examine the changes made to identify the root cause.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns around the time of the anomalies.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous state while investigation continues.
    * **Targeted Fixes:** Implement specific code fixes or configuration adjustments to address the identified problems.
