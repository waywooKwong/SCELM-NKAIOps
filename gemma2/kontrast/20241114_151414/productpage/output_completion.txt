{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a potential failure.  The 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  The 'request_success_rate' decreased, suggesting issues with service functionality, while 'request_count' also showed a downward trend, indicating a potential drop in user activity or system responsiveness. The 'SCWARN' algorithm also flagged anomalies at specific timestamps, further supporting the classification as a failure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the recent code modifications made before the data shift to identify potential bugs or configuration issues that might be causing the observed anomalies. 2. **Analyze logs and system behavior:** Examine system logs and monitor the service's behavior during the period of the anomalies to pinpoint the exact source of the problems. 3. **Rollback the changes (if possible):** If the anomalies are severe and impacting service functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. 4. **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Set up robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect future anomalies and facilitate quicker issue resolution."

While the overall trend for 'request_success_rate' shifted upwards, the mean value decreased, indicating a potential issue with request processing. Similarly, 'request_count' experienced an upward shift in mean value, suggesting an increase in traffic which may be straining the system.
