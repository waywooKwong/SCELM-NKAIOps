{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, istio_success_rate, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, diskio",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change. istio_count and istio_success_rate show drastic decreases, net_recv_packet and net_send_packet exhibit large fluctuations, and diskio remains at zero. These indicate potential issues with network communication and service performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the logs and system configurations related to network communication and the 'checkoutservice'.

Consider rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigations until the root cause is identified and addressed."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative impacts after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs demonstrate the most significant deviations:
    * `istio_count`: Drastically decreased, suggesting problems with Istio proxy communication.
    * `istio_success_rate`:  Significantly decreased, indicating failures in Istio service calls.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Large fluctuations, pointing to unstable network reception.
    * `net_send_packet`: Large fluctuations, suggesting instability in network transmission.
    * `diskio`:  At zero, implying the service is not accessing its disk storage, which could be a critical issue depending on its functionality.
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests problems with network connectivity, service communication, and potentially resource availability within the 'checkoutservice'.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on:
    * **Log Analysis:** Examining logs for errors related to network, Istio, and service operations.
    * **Configuration Review:** Checking recent changes to network settings, firewalls, load balancers, and Istio configurations.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Observing CPU, memory, and disk usage of the 'checkoutservice' and its dependencies to identify potential resource constraints.
    * **Rollback/Mitigation:**  Considering a rollback of the change if possible, or implementing temporary mitigations to stabilize the service until the root cause is found and resolved.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Failure" because multiple KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs demonstrate the most drastic changes post-deployment.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the upward trends in CPU usage, istio_count, and diskio, indicating increased resource consumption. The sharp decrease in istio_success_rate points to potential communication or processing issues within the service. The upward trend in net_send_packet might be a consequence of the increased resource consumption.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Analyze the changes made to pinpoint the source of the performance issues.
    * **Log and Monitoring Analysis:**  Deep dive into logs and system metrics to gain a clearer understanding of the behavior changes.
    * **Rollback or Mitigation:**  Depending on the severity and findings, consider rolling back the deployment or implementing strategies to manage the increased resource demands.

Consider network bandwidth limitations, latency issues, or potential congestion. 3. **Verify disk access:** Ensure that the 'checkoutservice' has sufficient disk space and that the disk I/O subsystem is functioning correctly. Check for any disk errors or configuration problems. 4. **Roll back the change:** If the issues persist after troubleshooting, consider rolling back the recent change to restore the previous state. "

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  net_recv_packet and istio_success_rate show substantial decreases, indicating potential communication issues. diskio shows a sharp reduction, suggesting a change in disk usage patterns. istio_count and cpu_usage also exhibit unusual trends.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `net_recv_packet`:  A significant decrease suggests network issues.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp drop indicates problems with service communication or request handling.
    * `diskio`: A sudden reduction could point to changes in data access patterns or storage limitations.
    * `istio_count`:  An increase could indicate increased load on the service mesh.
    * `cpu_usage`: An unusual trend might signal resource contention or inefficient code execution.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a systemic issue introduced by the change.  
* **Solution:**  The proposed solution emphasizes a thorough investigation to pinpoint the cause and implement corrective actions. This might involve:
    * Analyzing system logs for error messages or unusual activity.
    * Reviewing configuration changes made during the deployment.
    * Monitoring resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) to identify bottlenecks.
    * Testing the affected services to isolate the source of the problem.
