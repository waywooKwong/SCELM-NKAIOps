{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_success_rate, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  istio_duration and istio_success_rate  show decreased performance, memory_usage increased, and net_recv_packet  exhibited a significant change in range. Additionally, the newly generated log pattern suggests potential issues with the system's behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased memory usage and the changes in network traffic (net_recv_packet).

``` 


**Explanation of the Analysis:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **istio_duration:** Increased, indicating slower request processing times.
    * **istio_success_rate:** Decreased, suggesting a higher rate of failed requests.
    * **memory_usage:** Increased, potentially leading to resource constraints and performance issues.
    * **net_recv_packet:**  Significant change in range, indicating unusual network activity.
    * **istio_count:** While it increased, the context of the other KPIs suggests it might be a symptom of the overall issues rather than the primary cause.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs and the newly generated log pattern strongly suggests that the change introduced problems into the system.  

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific reasons behind the memory usage increase and the changes in network traffic.
    * **Log Pattern Analysis:**  Understanding the meaning of the new log pattern to pinpoint the source of the anomalies.
    * **Configuration Review:** Examining the changes made during the deployment to identify any problematic configurations.
    * **Resource Scaling/Optimization:**  Potentially increasing system resources or optimizing performance to handle the increased load or address the identified issues.
