* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights  `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `istio_duration`, `cpu_usage`, and `memory_usage` as the primary KPIs experiencing abnormal behavior.
* **Reason:** The  increased values in these KPIs point to the system struggling to handle the workload after the change. This suggests the changes might have introduced inefficiencies or increased resource demands.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issue through code review and performance analysis.  Optimization, resource allocation adjustments, and performance tuning are common strategies to address resource contention problems.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The five KPIs with the most significant changes are:
    * `net_send_packet`:  Increased fluctuations and a wider range of values.
    * `diskio`:  Increased activity, moving from a consistently low state to showing some activity.
    * `memory_usage`:  Increased negative values, indicating potential memory issues.
    * `istio_count`:  Increased fluctuations and a wider range of values.
    * `istio_duration`:  Increased fluctuations and a wider range of values.
* **reason:** The KPIs suggest the change introduced instability, leading to resource contention and potential performance degradation.
* **solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the recent changes, log analysis, and potential rollback or mitigation strategies.
