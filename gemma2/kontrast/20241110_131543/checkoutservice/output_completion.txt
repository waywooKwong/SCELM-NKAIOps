**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs show the most significant changes, indicating a direct impact of the change on the service's functionality.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows that the KPIs have moved outside their historical norms after the change, suggesting a negative impact on the checkout service's performance.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution outlines a structured approach to troubleshooting the issue, starting with identifying the root cause and then proposing potential remedies.
