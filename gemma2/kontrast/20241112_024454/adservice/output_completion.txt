**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_duration`: Increased variability suggests latency issues.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased success rate indicates problems with service requests being fulfilled.
    * `cpu_usage`: Unexpected drop could indicate inefficient resource utilization or unexpected behavior.
    * `memory_usage`: Similar to CPU usage, the drop might point to memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Decreased packet reception suggests network connectivity or processing issues.
* **Reason:** The change introduced issues that negatively affected system performance, stability, and communication.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes, log analysis, and potential rollback or implementation of mitigating measures.
