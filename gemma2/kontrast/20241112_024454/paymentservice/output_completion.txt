**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs show the most drastic changes after the software update. 
* **Reason:** The increased values in these KPIs suggest the software change may be causing the system to work harder, leading to potential performance bottlenecks.
* **Solution:**  A systematic approach is needed to address the issue:
    * **Investigation:**  Understand the exact nature of the software changes and how they might be affecting these KPIs.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine system and application logs for any error messages or unusual patterns that correlate with the change.
    * **Configuration Review:**  Ensure that all system configurations related to the changed software are correct and optimized.
    * **Rollback:** If the issue is severe and the impact is detrimental, consider rolling back the software change to restore stability.
    * **Performance Tuning:**  If a rollback is not feasible, focus on optimizing the system's performance to handle the increased load introduced by the change.

	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource usage:** Analyze the resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O) of the paymentservice during the anomaly periods. Identify any potential bottlenecks or resource starvation. 2. **Review logs and error reports:** Examine logs and error reports for the paymentservice during the anomaly timestamps. Look for patterns or messages that could indicate the cause of the abnormal behavior. 3. **Monitor service traffic:** Track the incoming and outgoing traffic of the paymentservice to identify any sudden spikes or unusual patterns. 4. **Scale resources:** If resource contention is identified, consider scaling up the resources allocated to the paymentservice. 5. **Optimize service performance:** Review the code and configuration of the paymentservice to identify any performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations."
