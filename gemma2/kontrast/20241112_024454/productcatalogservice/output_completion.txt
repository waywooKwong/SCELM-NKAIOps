**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs reflect a general performance degradation:
    * **net_recv_packet and net_send_packet:** Increased network activity could indicate a problem with the traffic switch or increased load.
    * **memory_usage, cpu_usage, diskio:** These metrics suggest the system is under more strain, potentially due to the software changes.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly links the change to the observed performance degradation.
* **Solution:** The suggested steps provide a structured approach to troubleshooting the issue:
    * **Investigation:**  Identify the specific problem areas.
    * **Code Review:**  Look for performance-related issues in the implemented changes.
    * **Mitigation:**  Consider reverting the change or implementing solutions to address the performance bottlenecks.
