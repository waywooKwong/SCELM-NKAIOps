``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates a "failure" because several KPIs exhibit abnormal behavior after the change.  

* **Increased Ranges:** KPIs like `net_recv_packet`, `istio_count`, `istio_success_rate`, `net_send_packet`, and `memory_usage` all show wider ranges after the change, suggesting greater fluctuations and potential instability.
* **Shifted Trends:** The overall trends of these KPIs have shifted, indicating a departure from the expected performance patterns.

The "solution" section provides a general approach to troubleshooting the issue.  A detailed investigation is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause and implement a targeted solution.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs demonstrate the most significant changes post-change. 
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the KPIs show increased variability and shifts in their ranges, pointing towards a performance degradation.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issue through code review, log analysis, and monitoring data. It also proposes temporary mitigation strategies while a permanent solution is developed.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests problems with service communication.
    * `istio_count`: A downward trend implies fewer successful service interactions.
    * `net_send_packet`: A decrease indicates potential network bottlenecks or issues with data transmission.
    * `istio_duration`: An increase means services are taking longer to communicate, likely due to processing delays or network congestion.
    * `memory_usage`: A shift in the range could point to memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the KPIs point to problems with service communication, network performance, and resource utilization.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review, log analysis, and potentially reverting the changes.
