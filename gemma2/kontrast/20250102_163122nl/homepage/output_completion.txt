``` 


Let me break down my reasoning:

* **Change Type:** "normal" - The absence of substantial KPI changes and the fact that the anomaly didn't lead to widespread system issues point towards a normal change classification.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Empty, as no KPIs are significantly outside acceptable limits.

* **Reason:**  The SCWARN alert is noteworthy, but it's important to consider the context:
    * The data states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold." This means the anomaly, while detected, didn't cause a noticeable performance dip.
    * We lack details about the nature of the SCWARN anomaly. It could be a minor event that didn't significantly impact system function.

* **Solution:**  Since the change is classified as normal, no immediate solutions are required. However, further investigation into the SCWARN anomaly at timestamp 2024-10-07 13:02:00 could be beneficial to understand its cause and prevent potential future issues.

**Explanation:**

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**: These KPIs directly reflect the performance degradation observed after the change. 
* **`reason`**: A concise explanation linking the KPI changes to a likely problem introduced by the change.
* **`solution`**:  Suggests steps to troubleshoot and address the identified issues.

**Explanation:**

}
```




**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: "failure" because the SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies, indicating a deviation from expected behavior. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  Placeholder - You need to replace this with the actual KPIs identified by the SCWARN algorithm as being anomalous. The prompt states to exclude KPIs named with 'build' in the list.
* **Reason**: The anomaly detection system (SCWARN) is a strong indicator of potential issues introduced by the change. 
* **Solution**:  A structured approach to troubleshooting is crucial:

    1. **Identify the Root Cause:** Analyze the code changes made around the time of the anomaly, examine system logs for error messages, and pinpoint the specific functions or components affected.
    2. **Investigate KPI Deviations:** Dig deeper into the anomalous KPIs.  What metrics are impacted? How severe is the deviation? 
    3. **Mitigate the Problem:** Based on the root cause analysis, implement corrective actions to fix the faulty code, adjust configuration settings, or address underlying system issues.

**Explanation:**

    * **Impact on Other KPIs:** Has this change in network traffic impacted other key metrics like system latency, error rates, or throughput?

* **Missing Information:** The analysis lacks details about:
    * **Pre-approved Process Adherence:**  Was the change implemented following established procedures?
    * **Post-Change Metrics Comparison:** How do the KPIs compare before and after the change?
    * **Impact Assessment:**  Has there been any noticeable degradation in system performance or user experience?

**Next Steps:**

1. **Gather More Data:** Collect additional metrics related to network traffic, system performance, and error logs.
2. **Analyze Traffic Patterns:** Investigate the nature of the anomalous network traffic to determine its cause and potential impact.
3. **Compare KPIs:** Analyze pre-change and post-change KPIs to identify any significant deviations.
4. **Conduct a Thorough Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the overall effect of the change on system stability, performance, and user experience.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Resource Contention",
	"reason": "The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies at specific timestamps indicating potential resource contention issues.  This suggests that the change likely introduced a bottleneck or increased demand on system resources, leading to performance degradation.",
	"solution": "1. **Identify Resource Bottlenecks:** Utilize monitoring tools and profiling techniques to pinpoint the exact resources (CPU, memory, network) experiencing high contention. 2. **Optimize Code and Configuration:** Review the code changes to identify potential areas for optimization that could reduce resource usage. Adjust system configurations to allocate resources more effectively. 3. **Scaling Strategies:** Consider scaling up hardware resources or implementing load balancing techniques if resource contention persists."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**:  "Failure" because the `Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes` indicator strongly suggests a problem. The SCWARN algorithm's alerts further confirm this.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: "Resource Contention" is listed as the primary anomaly, indicating a struggle for resources within the system.

* **Reason**: The combination of  "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" and the SCWARN alerts points to the change likely causing resource bottlenecks. This can lead to slowdowns, errors, and performance degradation.

* **Solution**: The suggested solutions focus on identifying the root cause (resource bottlenecks), optimizing code and configurations to reduce demand, and potentially scaling up resources if necessary.
