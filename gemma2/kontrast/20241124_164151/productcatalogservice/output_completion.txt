{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_recv_packet, cpu_usage, diskio, istio_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in several abnormal KPI trends.  'net_recv_packet' showed a 'Level shift down', indicating a decrease in received network packets. 'cpu_usage' increased significantly, suggesting higher resource consumption. 'diskio' showed a sharp upward trend, pointing to potential disk I/O bottlenecks. 'istio_count' also increased, implying more requests are being routed through Istio, which could strain the system. ",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased CPU usage and disk I/O. Analyze the Istio logs to understand the reason for the increased request volume. Review the configuration of the 'productcatalogservice' to identify any potential issues that might be contributing to the decrease in received network packets."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant deviations in KPIs like 'cpu_usage', 'diskio', 'istio_count', and the 'Level shift down' in 'net_recv_packet' clearly indicate a negative impact on the system's performance.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  We prioritize the KPIs showing the most drastic changes:
    * **net_recv_packet:** Decreased network packet reception.
    * **cpu_usage:**  Significant increase, indicating resource strain.
    * **diskio:**  Sharp rise, suggesting potential I/O bottlenecks.
    * **istio_count:** Increased Istio requests, possibly overloading the system. 

* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies points to a potential misconfiguration or unexpected workload on the 'productcatalogservice'.

* **Solution:**
    * **Investigate CPU Usage:** Identify the processes consuming the most CPU and optimize them.
    * **Analyze Disk I/O:**  Check for inefficient disk access patterns or bottlenecks. Consider optimizing disk configuration or storage.
    * **Review Istio Configuration:** Analyze the routing rules and policies in Istio to understand why requests are increasing. 
    * **Examine 'productcatalogservice' Configuration:** Review the service's settings and code for potential issues that might be causing the decreased network packet reception.

**Explanation of the Classification:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly indicates a negative impact on system performance following the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs highlight the most significant deviations:
    * **memory_usage:** A sharp decrease suggests potential memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * **cpu_usage:** An increase indicates the system is under higher load, potentially due to the change.
    * **istio_duration:**  Fluctuations in this metric suggest issues with service mesh communication and routing.
    * **net_recv_packet and net_send_packet:** Changes in these network metrics indicate potential problems with data transfer and processing.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced issues affecting memory management, CPU utilization, network communication, and overall system performance.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    1. **Code Review:** Analyze the changes made to identify potential issues in the code.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Examine system logs for events or errors coinciding with the KPI deviations.
    3. **Monitoring Data:**  Deep dive into monitoring data to pinpoint specific processes or events contributing to the anomalies.
    4. **Mitigation:** Based on the findings, implement appropriate solutions, such as reverting the changes, optimizing resource allocation, or addressing network configuration issues.

Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Failure Classification:** The KPIs show clear upward trends after the change, especially in memory usage, CPU usage, and network-related metrics. This points to a system struggling to handle the new workload or configuration.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  These metrics are directly impacted by the change and show the most significant deviations.
* **Reason:** The combination of increased KPIs and anomaly detection strongly suggests that the change introduced a problem. 
* **Solution:** The solution focuses on finding the root cause (code review) and then addressing the resource strain through optimization and monitoring.

* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a pattern of abnormal behavior.  Decreased CPU and memory usage could indicate a problem with resource utilization or a lack of workload. The near-zero diskio suggests potential issues with data access or storage. The increased istio_duration implies problems with service communication.
