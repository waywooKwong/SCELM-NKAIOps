{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, net_send_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change indicate a failure.  'istio_success_rate' dropped to 0, 'diskio', 'memory_usage', 'net_send_packet', and 'istio_duration'  show  increased variance and potential instability.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear downward trend and significant deviations from historical norms after the change.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The chosen KPIs highlight core system performance indicators that are severely impacted:
    * **'istio_success_rate'**: A drop to 0% indicates a complete failure of communication within the service mesh.
    * **'diskio'**: Increased variance suggests potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * **'memory_usage'**: Increased variance points to memory pressure.
    * **'net_send_packet'**:  Significant changes in network traffic could indicate misconfigurations or communication issues.
    * **'istio_duration'**: Increased latency in service calls suggests problems with routing or processing.

* **Reason:** The analysis points to a direct correlation between the implemented change and the observed anomalies. The specific nature of the "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" strongly suggests a misconfiguration or software bug as the root cause.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to resolving the issue:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Pinpointing the exact source of the problems.
    * **Log Review:** Examining system logs for clues about the failure.
    * **Configuration Review:** Carefully checking all configurations related to the affected services.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, reverting the change to restore previous functionality.
    * **Corrective Measures:** Implementing fixes to address the identified software defects or misconfigurations.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These KPIs were chosen because they demonstrate the most significant changes and potential impact on system functionality:
    * **memory_usage:**  A large increase indicates potential memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    * **istio_duration:**  Increased duration suggests issues with service communication or processing within Istio.
    * **net_send_packet and net_recv_packet:** Fluctuations in network traffic can point to problems with data transfer or communication protocols.
    * **diskio:**  An upward trend might indicate excessive disk I/O, which can bottleneck performance. 
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed KPI changes and their implications for system performance and resource usage.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the code changes, analyzing logs and monitoring data, and potentially reverting or optimizing the changes to restore normal system behavior.
