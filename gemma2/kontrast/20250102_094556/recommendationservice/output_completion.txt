**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The observed changes in metrics strongly suggest a problem within the system's operation.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: These KPIs were selected based on their significant deviations and potential impact on overall system health.  
* **reason**: A clear explanation is provided, linking the metric anomalies to potential issues with communication, processing, resource utilization, response times, and storage.
* **solution**:  Practical steps are outlined to address the identified problems:

    * **Investigation:** Thoroughly analyze logs, network traffic, and application performance data.
    * **Optimization:** Adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory) to ensure efficient use.
    * **Troubleshooting:** Identify and resolve network connectivity problems.
    * **Disk Monitoring:** Pay close attention to disk usage patterns and optimize storage operations if necessary.

Let me explain the reasoning:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`**  Since the prompt states "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal," this classification is accurate.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: "None"`** Because no KPIs exceeded their thresholds, there are no abnormal ones to list. 
* **`reason`:** This field summarizes why the change type is "normal" – the data itself supports a normal operational state.
* **`solution`:** When the system is functioning as expected, no specific solution is needed at this time.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, net_recv_packet, cpu_usage, net_send_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations from their expected ranges.  \n* `cpu_usage` dropped significantly, indicating potential resource underutilization or a system slowdown.\n* `net_recv_packet`, and `net_send_packet` both experienced sharp decreases, suggesting network connectivity issues or reduced traffic.\n* `istio_count` saw a notable change, which could point to problems with the Istio service mesh. \n *  `istio_duration` shows a slight upward trend, potentially hinting at increased latency in requests processed by the Istio mesh.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate network performance:** Monitor network traffic, bandwidth usage, and potential bottlenecks.\n2. **Analyze CPU resource utilization:** Check for processes consuming excessive CPU resources or inefficient code causing high load.\n3. **Review Istio configuration:** Examine settings related to routing, load balancing, and security policies for any misconfigurations that might be impacting performance.\n4. **Monitor logs and error messages:** Look for specific errors or warnings related to the affected KPIs to identify the root cause of the issue."
