**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the KPIs show a drastic shift after the change, indicating a problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Lists the two most affected KPIs: 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.
* **reason:** Explains the observed changes in the KPIs and suggests potential causes like bugs or misconfigurations.
* **solution:** Provides steps to troubleshoot the issue, including code review, log analysis, understanding the 'Deleting service' event, resource monitoring, and rolling back changes if necessary.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The provided data clearly shows anomalies in key metrics (`request_duration` and `request_count`) after the change, indicating a deviation from expected behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  While there's only two main KPIs affected, I list them both as they are directly correlated.
* **Reason:** The significant increase in `request_duration` and the shift in the trend of `request_count` suggest a performance degradation. This could be due to various factors introduced by the change, such as inefficient code, database issues, or resource contention.
* **Solution:**  The proposed solution focuses on debugging the code changes introduced during this deployment to pinpoint the root cause of the performance issues. Optimization techniques are suggested to improve system efficiency and address the observed anomalies.

**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure. Here's why:

* **Trend Reversals:**  The trend for both KPIs shifts from downward to upward, indicating an unexpected increase rather than the expected decrease.

These anomalies point towards a problem introduced by the recent change.

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided data, the change appears to be classified as "normal". Here's why:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** The metrics for `request_duration` and `request_count` show changes in their ranges but these changes are not substantial enough to indicate a significant negative impact on system performance. 
* **No Anomaly Detection:**  The SCWARN algorithm, responsible for anomaly detection, did not flag any anomalies during the change period.
* **Data Ranges:** While the data ranges for `request_duration` and `request_count` changed after the implementation, they remain within plausible bounds.

Therefore, considering the absence of significant KPI deviations and anomaly detection, the change is classified as "normal".

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**:  The significant shifts in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' clearly indicate a problem. The data ranges becoming much wider and trends changing suggest something went wrong.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: "request_duration, request_count". These are the two KPIs that show the most dramatic changes, pointing directly to the issue.

* **reason**: The explanation details the observed changes in the KPIs and how they point to a malfunction or misconfiguration.

* **solution**:  The steps outline a logical approach to troubleshooting:
    * Look at recent code changes for potential causes.
    * Examine logs for clues about what happened.
    * Understand how the anomaly detection algorithm works. 
    * Keep monitoring to ensure the issue is resolved.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The significant shift in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' suggests a problem with the service.  
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We list the two most impacted KPIs, 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.
* **reason:** The provided data clearly shows that the change caused these KPIs to deviate significantly from their previous behavior. This indicates a problem.
* **solution:** A combination of troubleshooting steps is recommended: reviewing code changes, comparing logs, investigating related incidents, rolling back changes if possible, and continued monitoring.

**Explanation:**

The data indicates a clear shift in the behavior of 'request_duration' and 'request_count' after the change.  These KPIs are crucial for understanding system performance, and their abnormal behavior suggests a problem. The solution steps focus on identifying the root cause (code review, log analysis) and addressing it (rollback if necessary).  Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure the issue is resolved.
