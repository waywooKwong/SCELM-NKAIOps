}
``` 



**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure.  Here's why:

* **Significant KPI Shifts:** Both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` experienced drastic changes in their ranges and trends after the change was implemented. This suggests a major disruption in how the system is functioning.
* **SCWARN Anomalies:** The SCWARN algorithm, which likely monitors system behavior for anomalies, flagged specific timestamps indicating problems. These need to be investigated.

**The provided solution focuses on:**

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the exact code changes or system events responsible for the KPI shifts and the SCWARN alerts.
2. **Troubleshooting:** Examining logs, resource usage, and potential performance bottlenecks to pinpoint the problem.
3. **Remediation:**  Implementing fixes based on the identified root cause and testing thoroughly to ensure stability.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear "failure" due to the following:

* **Drastic Shifts in KPIs:** Both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` exhibit significant shifts in their ranges and trends after the change. This strongly suggests that the change introduced a negative impact on the system's performance.
* **Negative Trend Changes:** The shift in `request_success_rate` to a more negative trend indicates a decline in the successful completion of requests, further pointing towards a failure.

**Actionable Solutions:**

The suggested solutions aim to pinpoint the root cause of the failure:

1. **Code Review:**  Identify potential bugs or misconfigurations introduced by recent code changes.
2. **Log Analysis:** Logs can reveal errors or warnings that occurred around the time of the anomaly, providing valuable clues about the problem.
3. **Infrastructure Check:** Recent infrastructure changes might be inadvertently impacting performance.
4. **Resource Monitoring:** Overloaded resources (CPU, memory, disk) can cause performance degradation.
5. **Rollback:** If possible, reverting to the previous state allows for quick recovery and further investigation.

	"solution": null
}
```  



**Explanation:**

While there were some unusual fluctuations in the data, the overall trend of both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` remained relatively stable. There were no dramatic spikes or sustained drops that would indicate a significant deviation from normal behavior. The lack of any substantial anomalies, coupled with the absence of a documented pre-approved change management process (which is not explicitly stated in your data), leads to the classification of this change as "normal."



Let me know if you have more context or specific thresholds for anomaly detection – that could refine the analysis.

**Explanation:**

* **No Significant Anomalies Detected:** The data clearly states that no anomalies were detected by the SCWARN algorithm, and there aren't any listed "Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies." This suggests that the change did not negatively impact system performance. 

* **KPI Range Changes Within Bounds:** While KPI ranges changed after the modification, these changes are described as being within expected bounds.  The text explicitly mentions this.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.  The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration. The 'request_count' shows a significant increase in maximum value and a shift in the overall trend from down to up, while 'request_success_rate' shows a decrease in both minimum and maximum values and a shift in the overall trend from up to down.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects related to handling requests and success rates. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Investigate the 'Deleting White List by Mistake- configuration' issue:** Given that the  'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' are significantly impacted, investigate if this anomaly is related to the 'Deleting White List by Mistake' configuration. Determine if any unintended consequences arose from this change.\n 4. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic to identify any bottlenecks or resource constraints that could be contributing to the anomalies. \n5. **Rollback changes:** If possible, consider rolling back the recent code changes to a previous stable state while investigating the issue further."
