{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes",
	"reason": "The anomaly detection system flagged 'Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes' as an issue.  This suggests the change introduced code defects that are causing resource contention within the system. The KPIs, while not showing immediate catastrophic failure, indicate a potential for future performance degradation and instability.",

}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" anomaly is a strong indicator of failure.  While other KPIs might not be drastically negative yet, this indicates a deeper issue that could lead to performance problems down the line.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We are focusing on the single most significant anomaly detected by the system: "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes". This points directly to a problem within the codebase itself.

* **Reason:** The  "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes" message means that the change likely introduced bugs or inefficiencies in how the software uses resources (like CPU, memory, or network). This can lead to programs fighting for the same resources, slowing down performance and potentially causing crashes over time. 

* **Solution:** The immediate priority is to pinpoint the faulty code responsible for this resource contention.  This may involve:
    * Re-examining recent code changes.
    * Using debugging tools to track resource usage during critical operations.
    * Reviewing logs for error messages related to resource allocation.

{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in anomalies related to key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'.  Although both KPIs show variations, the significant shifts in their trends, particularly the decrease in 'request_success_rate', point towards potential service availability or request processing issues. The SCWARN algorithm further supports this classification by flagging anomalies at a specific timestamp.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate code changes:** Review recent modifications to identify the root cause of the anomalies in 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. \n2. **Analyze system logs:** Examine logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data shifts.\n3. **Monitor affected KPIs:** Continuously track 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' to identify patterns or further deviations.\n4. **Rollback if severe:** If anomalies severely impact service functionality, consider rolling back the changes to restore previous performance.\n5. **Test & debug thoroughly:** Implement rigorous testing and debugging procedures to pinpoint and resolve the underlying causes of these KPI variations."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a potential failure because:

* **'request_success_rate' decrease:** A lower success rate suggests issues with handling requests, potentially leading to errors or slowdowns. This is a critical metric for service health.
* **'request_count' shift:** While 'request_count' shows an upward trend after the change, it's important to understand if this is due to increased user activity or a system issue causing more requests to be attempted (and possibly failing).

The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies, further supporting the possibility of a failure.
