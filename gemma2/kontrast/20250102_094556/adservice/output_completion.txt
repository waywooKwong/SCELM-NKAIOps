**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the KPI data shows significant abnormal spikes and trends after the change, suggesting a negative impact.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The listed KPIs show the most drastic shifts:
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `istio_count`:  Increased, indicating more traffic or requests being handled by Istio.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Increased, suggesting higher network load.
    * `net_send_packet`: While not as large an increase, it's still unusual to see a change in this direction without corresponding increases in others.

* **reason:**  The primary reason points to potential performance problems:
    * Resource contention (CPU and memory) 
    * Inefficient code execution causing higher resource consumption.

* **solution:** The suggested steps are common practices for addressing these types of issues:

    * **Code review:**  Find the root cause of increased resource usage.
    * **Optimization:** Make your code more efficient to reduce resource demand.
    * **Scaling:** If necessary, increase server capacity (CPU, memory) to handle the load.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this classification:

Let me break down why:

* **change_type:**  The provided information states that no indicator data exceeds the threshold. This means the change doesn't appear to be causing negative effects based on the monitored metrics. Therefore, we classify it as "normal".

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Since there are no abnormal KPIs identified, this field remains empty.

* **reason:** We explicitly state that all data falls within acceptable limits.

* **solution:** A solution is not required when the change is classified as "normal".

Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Failure Classification:**  The data shows clear anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) like `istio_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `memory_usage`. These negative values and significant deviations strongly suggest a problem.
* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** The three KPIs mentioned above are the most concerning because they directly relate to resource usage and system performance. 
* **Reasoning:**  The spike in `istio_usage` could indicate heavy traffic or issues with the Istio service mesh. Increased `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage` point to potential code inefficiencies, memory leaks, or insufficient resources allocated to the application.
* **Suggested Solution:** A thorough investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. This might involve:

    * **Code Review:** Examine recent changes for potential bugs or performance bottlenecks.
    * **Resource Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to identify patterns and triggers.
    * **Logging Analysis:**  Check logs for errors, warnings, or unusual activity related to the impacted services.

    * `istio_usage`: Suggests increased load or complexity within the Istio service mesh.
    * `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`: Indicate resource contention and potential system overload.
    * `net_send_packet`, `net_recv_packet`: Point to network performance issues, possibly due to increased traffic or inefficient data transfer.

    * `cpu_usage`: Increased CPU consumption could signal resource overload or inefficient code.
    * `memory_usage`: A decrease in memory usage might seem positive, but it could be a sign of memory leaks or improper allocation if accompanied by other performance issues. 
    * `net_recv_packet`: Changes in network reception rates can point to problems with network connectivity or data processing.
    * `istio_count`:  A shift in this metric might indicate changes in traffic patterns or service interactions within the Istio mesh.

* **reason:** The provided explanation emphasizes that multiple KPIs are affected, suggesting a systemic issue rather than an isolated problem. It highlights potential causes like resource contention and misconfiguration.
* **solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    *  **Root Cause Analysis:** Reviewing the changes made to pinpoint the source of the problems. 
    * **Log and Monitoring:**  Analyzing logs and performance metrics to identify specific errors or bottlenecks related to the affected KPIs.

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_usage, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_usage', 'cpu_usage', 'memory_usage', 'net_send_packet', and 'net_recv_packet' all exhibit increased ranges and in some cases, notably 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage',  higher average values. This suggests a potential strain on system resources following the change.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the recent modifications to identify the source of the increased resource consumption. 2. **Optimize resource utilization:** Analyze the performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations to reduce CPU and memory usage. 3. **Monitor system logs:**  Track error messages and system events for further insights into the issue. 4. **Roll back changes (if possible):** If the impact is severe, consider reverting the recent changes temporarily to assess the situation."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPI deviations strongly suggest a negative impact.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  These were chosen based on the magnitude of change and their relevance to overall system performance.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly indicates a performance degradation after the change, as evidenced by the wider ranges and increased average values for several critical KPIs.
* **Solution:**  A multi-faceted approach is suggested, starting with identifying the root cause through code review and log analysis. Optimization techniques, temporary rollbacks (if feasible), and continued monitoring are crucial steps in resolving this issue.
