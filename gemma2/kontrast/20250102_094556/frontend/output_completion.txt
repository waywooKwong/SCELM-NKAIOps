'memory_usage' also decreased, suggesting resource inefficiency. 'istio_duration' increased, pointing to slower response times. 'net_send_packet' and 'cpu_usage' while showing upward trends, could indicate increased load or bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'istio_success_rate' decline. Analyze resource utilization and optimize memory usage. Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks in 'istio_duration'. Monitor network traffic for potential congestion affecting 'net_send_packet'.  Consider scaling resources if CPU usage remains elevated."

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_send_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The  'istio_success_rate'  significantly decreased after the change, indicating potential issues with communication or service performance. 'istio_duration' also showed a large increase, suggesting latency problems. Additionally, 'net_send_packet', 'memory_usage', and 'cpu_usage' exhibit unusual changes in their ranges, pointing to resource consumption or system load fluctuations.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly shows significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change, suggesting a negative impact on system health and functionality.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are selected based on the magnitude of change and potential impact on system behavior:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp drop indicates communication problems within the service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency suggests slowdowns or performance bottlenecks.
    * `net_send_packet`: An unusual increase could point to increased network traffic or issues with data transmission.
    * `memory_usage` and `cpu_usage`:  Significant changes in these metrics signal potential resource contention or inefficient code execution.

* **Reason:** The explanation provides a clear connection between the observed KPI changes and potential problems like communication failures, latency issues, resource contention, and performance degradation.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on diagnosing the root cause of the problem by:
    * Analyzing logs and network traffic for errors or bottlenecks.
    * Examining resource utilization patterns to identify spikes and optimize application performance.
    * Considering a rollback if recent changes are identified as the primary cause of the anomalies.
