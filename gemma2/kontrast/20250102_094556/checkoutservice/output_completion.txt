{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_duration, diskio",
	"reason": "Multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, while 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' exhibit reduced values. 'diskio' has gone to zero, indicating potential system issues. While 'istio_duration' remains relatively stable, the overall pattern suggests a performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased 'istio_success_rate'. Analyze network traffic patterns for 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' to identify potential bottlenecks.  Examine system logs and resource utilization to pinpoint issues causing the 'diskio' drop. Monitor and adjust resource allocation if necessary."
}
``` 


**Explanation of Reasoning:**

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The sharp decline in 'istio_success_rate' points to a problem with service communication or processing.  The changes in 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' suggest network performance issues.
* **Zero 'diskio':** This is highly unusual. It could indicate a disk drive issue, system misconfiguration, or a process consuming all available disk I/O. 
* **Potential Cascading Effects:** The combined impact of these anomalies suggests a wider system problem rather than isolated incidents.

Let me break down why:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`** -  The provided data states that no indicator data exceeded its threshold. This indicates a normal operational state.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: `null`** - Since there are no abnormal KPIs, this field remains empty.
* **`reason`**: The clear reason is that the monitored metrics stayed within acceptable limits.
* **`solution`**:  A solution isn't necessary when the system is functioning normally.

	"solution": "Investigate the recent changes made to the system and identify the root cause of these abnormal metrics.  Consider rolling back the changes or implementing corrective measures to restore normal operation." 
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The provided data clearly indicates performance degradation after a change. This warrants classifying it as a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The most significant deviations are observed in 'istio_success_rate', 'diskio', 'net_recv_packet', 'istio_duration', and 'net_send_packet'. These KPIs suggest issues with network communication, system resource utilization, and service reliability.

* **reason:** The data analysis reveals a clear pattern of negative impact on key performance indicators after the change. This strongly points to the recent changes as the cause of the observed failures.
* **solution:**  The suggested solution emphasizes a structured approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Identify the Recent Changes:** Pinpoint exactly what modifications were made to the system before the performance issues emerged.
    2. **Root Cause Analysis:**  Dig deeper into the changes to understand how they might be causing the abnormal metric values. This could involve reviewing code, configuration files, or system logs.
    3. **Rollback or Corrective Action:** If possible, revert the problematic changes to restore normal operation. If a rollback isn't feasible, implement fixes to address the underlying issues identified in the root cause analysis.

* **reason**: The provided data clearly shows that these KPIs are not behaving as expected after the change, pointing to a potential system issue.
* **solution**:  This suggests a troubleshooting approach:

    1. **Identify the cause:** Analyze logs and monitoring data to pinpoint what triggered these changes.
    2. **Revert if necessary:** If the recent change is identified as the culprit, reverting it might be the quickest solution.
    3. **Further investigation:** If reverting isn't feasible or doesn't resolve the issue, deeper investigation into system configurations and dependencies is needed.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_recv_packet, istio_duration, diskio, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet' show large swings in values, 'diskio' is now consistently 0, and 'istio_duration' shows an unexpected increase. These indicate a potential problem with the service or its communication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the logs and system performance around the time of the change. Check for errors related to network connectivity, disk space, or issues within the 'istio' component. Monitor the affected KPIs closely and roll back the change if necessary."

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "All indicator data is within the established thresholds.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates that none of the monitored KPIs exceeded their defined thresholds.  This suggests the change did not negatively impact system performance or stability.
