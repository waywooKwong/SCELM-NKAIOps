	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, istio_success_rate, net_recv_packet, istio_count, diskio",
	"reason": "The analysis reveals several KPIs exhibiting abnormal behavior.  'net_send_packet' shows a 'Level shift down' anomaly, indicating a decrease in network sending packets. 'istio_success_rate'  shows a significant drop, suggesting issues with service requests being successful. 'net_recv_packet' has a large fluctuation, pointing to network reception inconsistencies. 'istio_count'  decreases, implying fewer service interactions. 'diskio'  drops to zero, potentially signifying a disk issue or lack of activity. These combined anomalies suggest a system disruption.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'Level shift down' in 'net_send_packet' and the sharp decrease in 'istio_success_rate'. Monitor the fluctuations in 'net_recv_packet' closely.  Examine the reasons behind the decrease in 'istio_count' and the zero activity in 'diskio'. Consider reviewing system logs and network traffic for further insights.  Potential solutions could include addressing network connectivity problems, optimizing service configurations, or investigating hardware issues."

KPIs like 'net_recv_packet', 'istio_success_rate', 'istio_count', 'cpu_usage', and 'diskio' show abnormal increases or decreases, indicating a potential disruption in system performance.

	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'newly generated log pattern'**: Analyze the content and context of these new logs to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. 2. **Review recent code changes**: Carefully examine the code changes associated with the implemented change to identify potential bugs or misconfigurations that might be affecting the KPIs. 3. **Monitor system resources**: Closely track CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O to identify resource bottlenecks that could be contributing to the performance degradation. 4. **Rollback the change**: If the investigation points to a specific faulty implementation, consider rolling back the change to restore previous system stability. 5. **Implement performance tuning**: Based on the identified issues, optimize system configurations and resource allocation to improve overall performance."
