}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly indicates abnormal behavior in several KPIs after the change. This suggests a negative impact on the system's performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    *  `net_send_packet`:  A large increase in the range of values suggests potential network congestion or increased data transfer.
    *  `diskio`:  While the range is small, any deviation from zero indicates disk activity that might be unusual.
    *  `memory_usage`: A significant increase in the range suggests potential memory pressure.
    *  `istio_count` and `istio_duration`: Increased counts and durations related to Istio (a service mesh) could point to issues with service communication or routing.
* **Reason:** The combination of increased data ranges and specific anomaly types points to a potential performance degradation and increased resource consumption. 
* **Solution:** A thorough investigation is needed to pinpoint the cause of these issues. This might involve:
    * **Code Review:** Examining recent changes for potential bugs or performance regressions.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Analyzing system and application logs for errors, warnings, or unusual patterns.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Tracking CPU, memory, network, and disk usage to identify bottlenecks.
    * **Performance Tuning:** Optimizing application code, database queries, and infrastructure configuration to improve performance.

	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the anomalies in the affected KPIs. This may involve reviewing system logs, monitoring resource consumption, and analyzing the impact of the recent change on the system's behavior. Once the root cause is identified, implement appropriate solutions to mitigate the issues and restore normal system performance."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their normal behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The list includes the KPIs that show the most significant changes after the change.
* **Reason:** The reason for the failure classification is clearly stated, highlighting the abnormal behavior of the selected KPIs.
* **Solution:**  A general solution is provided, emphasizing the need for root cause analysis and targeted solutions.
