{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "diskio, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "The KPIs 'diskio', 'cpu_usage', 'memory_usage', 'net_recv_packet', and 'net_send_packet' show significant deviations after the change. 'diskio' shows a decrease in range, while 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' show a decrease in range and potential shifts in overall usage patterns. 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet' also show changes in range and potential shifts in network traffic.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced with the change management process. Analyze the impact of the changes on system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and network traffic. Identify the specific code sections responsible for the observed anomalies and implement necessary corrections or optimizations. Consider rolling back the changes if the impact is deemed too severe."

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The provided data clearly indicates a "failure" as several key performance indicators (KPIs) deviate significantly after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs with the most notable changes are 'diskio', 'cpu_usage', 'memory_usage', 'net_recv_packet', and 'net_send_packet'. These reflect a potential issue with resource consumption and network performance.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the specific deviations in these KPIs, suggesting that the changes likely impacted how the system manages resources and handles network traffic.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on debugging the code changes, understanding their impact, and implementing corrective measures. Rolling back the changes is suggested if the issue is severe.
