**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" because the KPIs did not show significant deviations after the change. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there were no KPIs that showed significant abnormal increases or decreases.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while anomalies were detected, the overall KPI trends remained within expected ranges. This suggests the change did not cause a significant failure.
* **Solution:**  "N/A" because no failure was identified.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the submission.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  We select the top 3 most impactful anomalies:
    * **memory_usage:** Decreased significantly, suggesting potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.
    * **cpu_usage:** Decreased, which could indicate that the service is underutilized or experiencing issues processing requests.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased, implying delays in communication within the service mesh, potentially due to misconfigurations or increased traffic.
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies points to a potential performance issue introduced by the change. Decreased memory and CPU usage might suggest the service is struggling, while increased istio_duration indicates communication bottlenecks.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on identifying the root cause through investigation, optimization, and log analysis.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior, indicating potential performance issues.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **memory_usage:** Increased significantly after the change, suggesting the service is consuming more memory.
    * **istio_duration:**  Also increased, indicating potential delays in communication within the service mesh (Istio).
    * **net_recv_packet & net_send_packet:**  Deviations from historical trends suggest network traffic patterns have changed.
    * **diskio:**  Unusual behavior might point to disk access issues.

* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests the change introduced problems related to resource consumption (memory), communication efficiency (Istio), and potentially network and disk I/O.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Code Review:** Examining the recent code changes to pinpoint the cause of increased memory usage and Istio delays.
    * **Network Analysis:**  Investigating the changes in network traffic patterns to identify bottlenecks.
    * **Disk Monitoring:** Ensuring sufficient storage capacity and optimizing disk access patterns to address potential disk I/O issues.
