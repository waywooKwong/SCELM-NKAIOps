{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_success_rate, diskio, cpu_usage, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show a significant decline after the change.  'istio_duration' shows a steady increase, indicating potential latency issues. 'istio_success_rate' drops sharply, suggesting problems with request completion.  'diskio', 'cpu_usage', and 'net_send_packet' also exhibit downward trends, pointing to resource contention or network issues.",

Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) closely and optimize resource allocation if necessary.  Review network configurations and troubleshoot any potential bottlenecks."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple crucial KPIs show a concerning downward trend after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_duration`:  A steady increase indicates potential latency problems within the service.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp drop suggests that requests are failing more frequently.
    * `diskio`, `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`: These show downward trends, hinting at resource contention or network issues.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced performance problems. The increased latency, failed requests, and resource contention all point to a need for investigation.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Code Review:**  Analyzing the recent code changes to pinpoint the source of the performance issues.
    * **Resource Monitoring:**  Closely watching CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage to identify bottlenecks.
    * **Network Troubleshooting:**  Checking network configurations and addressing any potential bandwidth or connectivity problems.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations or anomalies detected. The 'net_send_packet' KPI shows a 'Steady increase' anomaly, but this is the only anomaly reported and doesn't indicate a system-wide failure.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no significant performance degradations. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no top 5 KPIs responsible for a failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while there's a 'Steady increase' in 'net_send_packet', this is an isolated anomaly and doesn't point to a widespread system failure. Other KPIs like 'istio_success_rate', 'diskio', 'cpu_usage', 'istio_count', 'net_send_packet', 'istio_duration', and 'net_recv_packet' show trends within expected ranges.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified.
