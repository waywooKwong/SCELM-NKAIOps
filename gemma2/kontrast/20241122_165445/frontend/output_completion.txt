**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations from their pre-change behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen because they demonstrate the most significant changes and likely point to the core issues.
* **Reason:** The provided analysis explains the nature of the deviations and how they point to potential problems in service communication, network performance, resource management, and overall system stability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on targeted investigation and optimization steps to address the identified issues.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic decrease suggests problems with communication or service invocation.
    * `net_recv_packet`: A significant increase could indicate increased network traffic or potential issues with data reception.
    * `istio_count`: An increase might point to more frequent service calls or potential bottlenecks within the Istio service mesh.
    * `net_send_packet`:  A rise in this KPI could indicate more data being sent out, potentially due to errors or increased workload.
    * `memory_usage`: A shift in memory usage could suggest the change is consuming more resources or causing memory leaks. 

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests the change negatively impacted system performance, communication, and resource utilization.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review, log analysis, and potentially rolling back the change.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  Classified as "failure" due to the substantial deviations in KPIs like 'istio_success_rate', 'istio_duration', 'net_recv_packet', 'net_send_packet', and 'memory_usage'. These indicate a negative impact on system performance.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs highlight areas of concern:
    * **'istio_success_rate':** A drastically reduced range suggests problems with service communication.
    * **'istio_duration':** Increased range and downward trend point to latency issues.
    * **'net_recv_packet', 'net_send_packet':** Changes in range indicate potential network problems.
    * **'memory_usage':**  Changes in range suggest possible resource contention.

* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the significant changes in these KPIs point to a negative impact on the system's performance and functionality.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on addressing the root causes identified:
    * Investigate service communication issues.
    * Analyze and optimize latency.
    * Monitor and address network and resource constraints.
