``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis clearly states that no KPIs exceeded their thresholds after the change. This means the system performed as expected, and there were no significant deviations from normal behavior.  

Therefore, the classification is "normal," and no solutions are needed.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, memory_usage, istio_duration, net_recv_packet, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs).  We observed a spike in `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet` indicating increased network traffic, while `memory_usage` and `cpu_usage` also saw upward trends suggesting resource contention.  `istio_duration` increased, pointing to potential delays in service requests.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased network traffic and resource consumption. Analyze logs and system configurations to identify any changes or misconfigurations that might be contributing to the issues. Consider scaling resources, optimizing application performance, or implementing traffic management strategies to mitigate the impact."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  These KPIs were chosen based on the magnitude of the changes and their potential impact on system stability:
    * `net_send_packet`:  A significant increase suggests heightened network activity, which could strain resources.
    * `memory_usage`:  The upward trend indicates potential memory pressure, leading to performance degradation.
    * `istio_duration`:  Increased request durations point to delays in service responses, negatively affecting user experience.
    * `net_recv_packet`:  A large increase indicates a surge in incoming network traffic, potentially overwhelming the system.
    * `cpu_usage`:  Higher CPU utilization suggests the system is working harder, which can lead to slower response times and increased errors.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly points to a failure because the KPIs indicate a system under stress due to increased network traffic and resource consumption.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the problem and implementing mitigation strategies. This involves:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Examining logs, system configurations, and recent changes to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Resource Scaling:**  Increasing available resources (memory, CPU) if the system is genuinely overloaded.
    * **Performance Optimization:**  Analyzing and improving application code to reduce resource consumption and enhance efficiency.
    * **Traffic Management:** Implementing strategies like load balancing and rate limiting to distribute traffic effectively and prevent overload.

	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to identify the root cause of these KPI deviations. Review logs and system metrics for further insights. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing corrective measures to restore normal service performance."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The most significant deviations are in `istio_success_rate`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `net_send_packet`, and `istio_duration`.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests a problem with the service. Reduced success rate, lower disk and memory usage, decreased network sending, and increased latency all point to potential issues with the service's functionality or resource utilization.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the specific code changes that likely caused the issue.
    * **Log and Metric Review:**  Examine system logs and detailed metrics for clues about the nature of the problem.
    * **Rollback or Correction:**  Consider reverting the changes if possible or implementing fixes to address the identified issues.
