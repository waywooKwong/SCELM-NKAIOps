**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs with the most significant deviations are selected.  
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the specific KPI changes and their implications for system performance.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting the identified issues and potentially reverting the change if necessary.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change indicate a failure.  \n* istio_duration shows a large increase in latency.\n* istio_success_rate sees a significant increase, suggesting more failures.\n* cpu_usage and memory_usage both show larger fluctuations.\n* net_recv_packet shows a substantial increase.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in these KPIs.  Review logs and system configurations around the time of the change.  Consider reverting the change if possible or implementing mitigating strategies to stabilize the system."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The significant changes in KPIs like `istio_duration`, `istio_success_rate`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, and `net_recv_packet` point towards a failure.  These metrics indicate a degradation in system performance and stability.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The listed KPIs are the most affected and directly contribute to the observed failure symptoms.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the nature of the deviations in each KPI and how they collectively point to a system failure.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the issue. It also recommends reverting the change if possible or implementing solutions to stabilize the system.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change. istio_duration increased, istio_success_rate decreased, cpu_usage and memory_usage showed unusual trends, indicating potential performance degradation and resource consumption issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the KPI changes. Review the implemented changes and identify any potential conflicts or unintended consequences. Optimize resource allocation and system configurations to address the observed performance issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" 
    * The provided KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.  
    * `istio_duration` increasing suggests latency problems.
    * `istio_success_rate` decreasing means requests are failing more often.
    *  `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage` trends indicate potential resource bottlenecks.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    *  `istio_duration`, `istio_success_rate`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage` are the most critical indicators of performance degradation.
    *  We exclude KPIs named with 'build' as per your instruction.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly points to a failure. The system is experiencing performance issues, with slower responses, increased errors, and potentially inefficient resource utilization.

* **Solution:**
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  A detailed investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause of the changes. This might involve reviewing logs, monitoring system behavior, and analyzing the code changes made.
    * **Configuration Optimization:**  Adjust system settings, resource allocation, and caching mechanisms to improve performance and address resource bottlenecks.
    * **Code Review:** If the changes involved code modifications, a thorough review is essential to identify any bugs or inefficiencies that might be contributing to the problems.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights `istio_duration`, `istio_success_rate`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, and `net_send_packet` as the most significantly impacted KPIs.
* **Reason:** The KPIs indicate a failure because:
    *  `istio_duration` and `istio_success_rate`  show a significant increase in variability and negative trends, suggesting performance issues with the service.
    * `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage` show increased ranges, indicating potential resource contention.
    * While `net_send_packet` shows a minor shift, the overall pattern points towards a negative impact.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting the issue:
    *  **Investigate code changes:**  Identify the specific changes introduced during the deployment that might be causing the performance problems.
    * **Analyze logs and metrics:**  Gather more detailed information about system behavior before and after the change to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Rollback or optimization:** Consider reverting the changes if they are causing significant harm or implement performance optimizations to address the underlying problems.
