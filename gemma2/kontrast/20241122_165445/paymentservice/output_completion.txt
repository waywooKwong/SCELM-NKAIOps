**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" 
    *  The metrics show no significant degradation in system performance.
    * The anomalies detected are temporary spikes that recovered quickly.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A"
    * Since the change type is classified as "normal", there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.

* **Reason:** The analysis points to temporary fluctuations rather than persistent issues. The KPIs remain within acceptable ranges, and the anomalies detected are of a type that suggests temporary disruptions rather than ongoing problems.

* **Solution:** "N/A"
    * As the change is not classified as a failure, no specific solution is required.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs demonstrate the most drastic changes post-change, suggesting they are central to the failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the abnormal fluctuations in KPIs, indicating a potential problem with the implemented changes. The SCWARN algorithm's identification of anomalies further strengthens this conclusion.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the changes made to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize logs around the anomaly timestamps to gain insights into system behavior during the failure.
    * **Performance Monitoring:** Continue monitoring system performance metrics to track the effectiveness of any implemented solutions.
    * **Mitigation:**  If reverting the change is not feasible, implement strategies to address resource contention and stabilize the service.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from the normal range.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights "net_send_packet", "memory_usage", "istio_count", and "istio_duration" as the primary indicators of failure. 
* **Reason:** The increased negative values and wider ranges in these KPIs suggest potential problems with:
    * **Network communication:**  "net_send_packet" indicates potential issues with sending network packets.
    * **Resource utilization:** "memory_usage" and "istio_count" point to possible memory pressure or increased load on the Istio service mesh.
    * **Latency:** "istio_duration" suggests increased latency in communication within the Istio mesh.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Code review:** Examining the changes made to pinpoint the source of the issues.
    * **Log analysis:**  Deep-diving into logs to understand resource usage patterns and network behavior.
    * **Performance optimization:** Scaling resources or optimizing code to improve efficiency and address resource contention.
