**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their normal ranges, suggesting a negative impact on the system's performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The list prioritizes KPIs with the most significant changes:
    * **net_send_packet:** Abnormal increases and decreases could indicate network congestion or issues with communication protocols.
    * **memory_usage:**  Increased memory usage might point to memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * **istio_count:**  Changes in the number of Istio requests could signal problems with service discovery or routing.
    * **istio_duration:**  Longer Istio request durations suggest potential delays or bottlenecks in service communication.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows that several key KPIs have moved outside their historical norms after the change. This strongly suggests that the change introduced issues.
