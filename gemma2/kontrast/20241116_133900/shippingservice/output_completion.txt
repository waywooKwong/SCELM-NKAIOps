{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, net_send_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators.  'istio_success_rate' dropped to 0, indicating a complete failure of communication. 'diskio', 'memory_usage', 'net_send_packet', and 'istio_duration' all showed increased volatility and deviations from historical norms, suggesting resource contention or service instability.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative impact after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The listed KPIs demonstrate the most significant deviations from expected behavior. 
* **Reason:** The analysis points to a clear failure scenario based on the drastic drop in 'istio_success_rate' and the increased volatility in other key metrics.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the specific reason for the communication failure.
    * **Configuration Review:** Check for any unintended changes or misconfigurations introduced during the change process.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Analyze resource usage and consider scaling or optimizing resources to handle the increased load or potential bottlenecks.
    * **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies like this in real-time and enable faster responses.

``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates a **failure** because several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change. 

* **Communication Issues:** The `istio_success_rate` dropping to 0 suggests major problems with service communication within the system.
* **Resource Contention:** The increase in `diskio`, `memory_usage`, and `net_send_packet` indicates that the system is struggling to handle the workload, potentially due to insufficient resources or inefficient processes.
* **Latency Problems:** The rise in `istio_duration` points to increased latency in service calls, which can negatively impact user experience and application performance.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" - The analysis states that KPIs are within historical norms and there are no significant deviations.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  "" - Since the change type is "normal," there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The reason provided explains that while anomalies were detected, they don't necessarily indicate a failure.  More investigation is needed to understand the nature of these anomalies.
* **Solution:** No solution is provided because the change is classified as "normal."
