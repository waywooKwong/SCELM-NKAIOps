	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations or degradations in system performance.  The 'SCWARN' algorithm identified anomalies, but these are described as 'recover to normal state' anomalies, suggesting temporary fluctuations rather than persistent issues.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs didn't show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there were no KPIs that significantly deviated from normal. 
* **Reason:** The analysis points out that while anomalies were detected, they were temporary fluctuations ("recover to normal state") and didn't cause lasting negative impacts on system performance.
* **Solution:**  "N/A" because no failures or persistent issues were identified.
