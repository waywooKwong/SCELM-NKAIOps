{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "The KPIs 'istio_success_rate', 'diskio', and 'net_recv_packet' show significant deviations after the change. 'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, 'diskio'  decreased to near zero, and 'net_recv_packet'  increased significantly.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the metrics show clear negative impacts after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We focus on the KPIs with the most drastic changes:
    * **'istio_success_rate'**: A significant drop suggests problems with service communication and routing.
    * **'diskio'**: A near-zero value indicates potential disk space exhaustion or I/O performance issues.
    * **'net_recv_packet'**: A large increase might point to network congestion or misconfigurations.
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests a failure. The communication breakdown ('istio_success_rate'), resource contention ('diskio'), and network overload ('net_recv_packet') are interconnected and point to a systemic issue.
* **Solution:** The suggested steps address the core problems: investigate the communication failures, check for disk space/I/O problems, and optimize network settings.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs didn't show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "None" because there were no KPIs that significantly deviated from normal ranges.
* **Reason:** The analysis of the KPIs and the SCWARN algorithm's findings suggest that the change did not negatively impact the system's performance.
* **Solution:**  Not applicable since the change was classified as normal.
