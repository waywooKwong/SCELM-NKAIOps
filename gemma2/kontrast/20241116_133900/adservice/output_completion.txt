	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_success_rate, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show decreased performance, 'memory_usage' increased, and 'net_recv_packet' and 'istio_count' exhibit unusual fluctuations.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the clear performance degradation indicated by the KPIs.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs show the most significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed issues â€“ decreased performance in 'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate', increased 'memory_usage', and unusual fluctuations in 'net_recv_packet' and 'istio_count'. This points to a problem with the implemented change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution is a logical next step:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the code changes for potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs around the time of the anomalies to identify specific events or patterns related to the problematic KPIs.
    * **Reverting/Fixing:**  Consider reverting the change if the impact is severe, or implement targeted fixes to address the identified issues.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The list includes KPIs showing the most significant negative changes:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, indicating slower request processing.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased, suggesting more failed requests.
    * `cpu_usage`:  Changed, indicating potential resource strain.
    * `memory_usage`: Changed, also indicating potential resource strain.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Decreased, hinting at network issues. 
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed KPI deviations and their potential implications.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting the issue by:
    * Identifying the root cause through logs, resource monitoring, and network analysis.

``` 


**Explanation:**

Based on the analysis of the provided data:

* **KPI Values:** The KPIs show no significant deviations from their historical ranges.
* **Anomaly Detection:** While the SCWARN algorithm identifies anomalies, the description indicates they are not persistent and return to normal states. This suggests these anomalies might be transient fluctuations rather than indicators of a failed change.
* **Absence of Degradation:** There's no mention of system latency increases, error rate spikes, or uptime reductions, which are typical symptoms of a failed change.

Therefore, the change is classified as "normal" based on the available information.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The chosen KPIs represent the most significant deviations:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, indicating slower request processing.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased, implying more failed requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased range, suggesting the system is working harder.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased range, pointing to potential memory pressure.
    * `net_send_packet`: While slightly increased, it could be linked to the other changes.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs strongly suggests that the change negatively impacted the system's performance and resource utilization. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the problem and taking corrective actions. This might involve:
    * **Debugging:** Analyzing logs and code to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Configuration Review:** Checking if any misconfigurations contributed to the problem.
    * **Rollback:** If the issue is severe, reverting the change might be necessary.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continuously monitoring the system to ensure the problem is resolved and prevent future occurrences.
