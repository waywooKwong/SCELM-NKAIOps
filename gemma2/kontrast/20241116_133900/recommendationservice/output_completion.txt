**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The listed KPIs are the most impacted, indicating potential issues with service communication (istio_success_rate), resource utilization (diskio, cpu_usage), and network traffic (net_send_packet, istio_count).
* **Reason:** The provided data shows a clear pattern of degradation in key performance indicators after the change. This strongly suggests the change introduced bugs or inefficiencies.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the code changes to identify potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs around the time of the anomalies to pinpoint specific events or errors.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous stable state while investigation continues.
    * **Corrective Measures:**  Once the root cause is identified, implement fixes to address the performance issues.
