Let me explain the reasoning:

* **No Threshold Exceedances:** The analysis states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal." This is the key factor indicating a normal change.
* **Stable KPIs:**  The data describes the KPIs' ranges and trends before and after the change. While there are some shifts, none of them indicate a significant deviation or failure.

Consider optimizing network settings, load balancing, or DNS resolution. 3. **Analyze 'istio_duration' increase:** Investigate the reasons for the increased latency in Istio requests. This might involve profiling the application code, analyzing Istio policies, or checking for resource contention. 4. **Monitor and optimize memory usage:**  Track the memory consumption of the service and identify potential memory leaks or resource contention. Adjust application settings, optimize code, or consider scaling resources as needed. 5. **Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring:**  Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to capture detailed information about the service's behavior, including error messages, performance metrics, and resource utilization.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" -  The analysis states that KPIs are within historical norms and there's no significant performance degradation.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" - Since the change type is "normal," there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The provided data and the absence of significant KPI deviations suggest a normal change. The anomalies detected by SCWARN require further investigation to determine their impact and significance.
* **Solution:**  "N/A" -  No solution is required as the change is classified as normal.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the submission.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The chosen KPIs are those with the most drastic changes, indicating a significant impact on system performance.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a decline in  `istio_success_rate` and a significant increase in `istio_duration`, suggesting problems with service mesh communication.  The changes in `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, and `memory_usage` point to potential network or resource-related issues.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the source of the problems in `istio_success_rate` and `istio_duration`.
    * **System Review:** Examining logs and configurations related to network performance and memory usage.
    * **Mitigation:** Reversing the change if possible or implementing fixes to address the identified issues.
