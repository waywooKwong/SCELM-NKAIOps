**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**:  The analysis reports only one anomaly found. This single anomaly doesn't indicate widespread system disruption or a clear failure.  
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs**: Since there is only one anomaly, this list is not applicable.
* **Reason**: The metrics provided show that while an anomaly was detected, the overall changes in key performance indicators (KPIs) like `request_count` and `request_success_rate` remain within expected ranges. There's no evidence of significant degradation in system performance.
* **Solution**: As there is no clear indication of failure, a solution isn't necessary at this time. Further investigation might be needed to understand the nature of the single detected anomaly.

Let me break down why this change is classified as 'normal':

* **No KPI Deviations:** The metrics provided show that there are no significant changes in key performance indicators (KPIs) like `request_count` and `request_success_rate` after the change.  Both stayed within their normal ranges. 
* **Absence of Anomalies:** The SCWARN algorithm, which is designed to detect anomalies, didn't flag any issues during the analysis period. This suggests that the change did not cause any unexpected behavior patterns.

	"reason": "The change resulted in anomalies related to 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'. These KPIs indicate a deviation from expected behavior patterns.  Although the provided data is limited, the SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies at 2024-10-07 18:52:00 suggesting a potential issue with the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this deployment, particularly those affecting request handling and success rate calculations.

Additionally, compare pre-change and post-change system behavior to identify any regressions."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the metrics show anomalies, indicating a deviation from expected behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The data points to `request_count` and `request_success_rate` as primary indicators of the issue. 
* **Reason:** The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies specifically at a particular time (2024-10-07 18:52:00). This suggests that the change introduced a problem that manifested at this point.
* **Solution:**  The solution focuses on code review, log analysis, and comparing system behavior before and after the change to isolate the root cause of the anomalies in `request_count` and `request_success_rate`.
