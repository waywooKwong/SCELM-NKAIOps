* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We list `net_send_packet`, `istio_count`, and `cpu_usage` as they show notable changes. However, remember that "abnormal" in this context means a deviation from the baseline, not necessarily a problem. 
* **reason:** We explain that the observed variations are within acceptable ranges and don't point to a systemic issue.
* **solution:**  Since it's a normal scenario, we recommend continued monitoring for any unusual trends.
