**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The significant shifts in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' clearly indicate a negative impact on system performance, pointing towards a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  The two most critical KPIs affected are specified.
* **reason**:  The provided data directly supports the conclusion that the change caused a failure due to the unusual behavior of these KPIs.
* **solution**: The suggested steps involve:
    *  **Code review:** Identifying potential bugs or misconfigurations introduced by the recent changes.
    * **Log analysis:** Tracing system activity logs around the time of the anomaly to pinpoint the exact cause. 
    * **Monitoring:** Continuously observing KPIs after implementing solutions to ensure stability and prevent recurrence.

}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No Exceeding Thresholds:** The analysis states that all KPIs remained within their historical norms and there was no significant degradation in system performance. This aligns with the definition of a normal change. 
* **Limited Anomalies:** While the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies, it's important to note:
    *  The number of total anomalies is -1 (This seems like an error). We need to clarify this with the data provider.
    * The analysis specifies that there are no anomalous KPIs related to overall anomalies. This means even if some anomalies were detected, they weren't severe enough to significantly impact the system. 

Given the lack of substantial performance degradation and absence of critical KPI anomalies, I classify this change as "normal".

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Pre-Approved Process Adherence:**  We don't have information about the change management process followed. 
* **Post-Change Metrics Comparison:** The provided data shows both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` exhibiting upward trends before and after the change. While the ranges of these metrics changed, the overall trend remained consistent. This suggests no immediate significant degradation in system performance.
* **Impact Assessment:**  With no substantial deviations or unusual spikes in key performance indicators, and considering that "Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies" are empty, the change appears to have followed expected patterns.

**Important Note:** While this analysis points towards a 'normal' change, more detailed information about the specific application and its expected behavior would strengthen the conclusion.

**Explanation:**

The analysis clearly states that there were no anomalous KPIs identified. The `SCWARN` algorithm, which is responsible for detecting anomalies, found no instances of abnormal behavior.  Since there are no indicators of performance degradation or unusual patterns, the change can be classified as "normal".

This indicates potential issues with the service's ability to handle requests effectively.",

Review logs for error messages and performance bottlenecks. Consider reverting the changes or implementing a rollback strategy if the issue persists."
