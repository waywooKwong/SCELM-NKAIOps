**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The observed changes in key metrics point to a negative impact, indicating a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We list the most significantly affected KPIs:
    * `diskio`:  A sudden increase suggests potential disk I/O issues.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp drop implies problems with service requests being successfully handled.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`: Changes in these network metrics could indicate communication bottlenecks or issues with the application's network behavior.
    * `istio_duration`:  While it didn't drastically change, the trend alongside other KPIs suggests a potential performance slowdown. 

* **reason**: The explanation clearly links the abnormal metrics to a negative system impact – performance degradation and reliability issues.

* **solution**: The suggested solution provides a structured approach:
    1. **Investigate disk I/O:** Identify the source of the `diskio` increase.
    2. **Analyze logs and network data:** Understand the impact on service requests (`istio_success_rate`) and network performance. 
    3. **Consider reverting the change or implementing mitigations:**  Take action to address the root cause.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**:  The significant deviations in KPIs strongly suggest a negative impact from the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: I've listed the KPIs with the most drastic changes, avoiding any that might be related to build processes ("build").
* **reason**: The explanation clearly states the observed KPI issues and how they point to potential problems in different areas (network, performance, resources).
* **solution**:  The suggested solution is a general approach:

    1. **Diagnose:** Find the cause of the issues through logs, resource monitoring, and code review.
    2. **Rollback (if necessary):** If recent changes are identified as the problem, revert them. 
    3. **Further Analysis:**  More detailed investigation is needed to solve the underlying problem.

	"reason": "Several key KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' drops drastically, indicating communication issues. 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet' also decrease, pointing to network problems. 'diskio' reaching zero could signal a system freeze or data access failure. 'istio_duration' increasing suggests processing delays within the service mesh.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate network connectivity:** Check for bandwidth issues, routing problems, or firewall conflicts affecting communication between services. 2. **Analyze disk usage and I/O performance:** Verify sufficient disk space and examine logs for any errors related to disk access. 3. **Monitor service mesh components:**  Inspect logs and metrics of the Istio control plane and sidecar proxies for signs of resource contention or configuration issues."

{
	"change_type": "normal",

	"reason": "This set of data has been tested, and all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal.",
	"solution": null
}
``` 


Let me break down why this response fits the criteria:

* **change_type:**  The provided data indicates no KPI values exceeded their thresholds. This suggests the change was within expected parameters, hence "normal".
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Since there are no KPIs exceeding thresholds, this field remains null (empty).
* **reason:** A clear explanation is given that aligns with the data: all indicators fall within acceptable ranges.
* **solution:**  Because there's no failure to address, a solution is not required and remains null.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "All indicator data falls within the established threshold.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates that none of the key performance indicators (KPIs) exceeded their defined thresholds. This suggests that the system is operating within normal parameters.  Therefore, the classification is "normal". Since there are no abnormal KPIs, the fields "Top 5 abnormal kpi", "reason", and "solution" are left as "N/A".
