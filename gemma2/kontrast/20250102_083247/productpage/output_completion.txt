Let me break down my reasoning:

* **Change Type:**  I've classified this as "failure" based on the provided information. While the KPIs themselves don't show a catastrophic drop, the presence of anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm is a significant red flag. This suggests that something unexpected happened during or after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The most crucial indicators are `request_success_rate` and `request_count`.  Anomalies in these metrics suggest issues with how the service handles requests, which directly impacts user experience.

* **Reasoning:** The "Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies" mentioned in your data strongly point towards potential problems stemming from the change itself. Even though the changes seem relatively minor ("Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes"), these types of issues can have ripple effects throughout a system.
* **Solution:** The next steps involve deeper investigation:

   1.  **Analyze SCWARN Anomalies:** Dive into the details of what the SCWARN algorithm detected. This might reveal specific timestamps, affected components, or error patterns.

   2. **Log Review:** Examine logs from the time period around the change. Look for unusual activity, errors, warnings, or anything that seems out of place.
   3.  **Change Reassessment:** Carefully review the code changes made during this deployment.  Look for potential logic errors, misconfigurations, or interactions with other systems that might have gone unnoticed. 



Let me know if you have any more details about the change itself or the specific anomalies detected. I'd be happy to provide more targeted guidance!

**Explanation:**

* **`change_type: "failure"`**: The data clearly shows a negative impact on system performance after the change, making it a failure.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: "request_success_rate, request_count"`**: These are the two KPIs that show the most significant anomalies directly related to the performance decline.
* **`reason:`**: The explanation emphasizes the observed anomalies and their implications on system health.  The specific types of anomalies ("Level shift down" and "Steady increase") provide concrete evidence of the problem.
* **`solution:`**: A structured approach is suggested for resolving the issue, focusing on debugging the code changes and monitoring the system's response.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" - The metrics provided show no significant changes or abnormal spikes that would indicate a failure. 

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  Not applicable because the change didn't result in any anomalies.

* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that all KPI values remain within historical norms, and there are no records of new log patterns or unexpected system behavior. This suggests the change was successfully implemented without causing negative impacts on the service. 

* **Solution:** No solution is needed because the change appears to have functioned as expected.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The observed drop in `request_success_rate` and shift in `request_count` strongly suggest that the change introduced problems. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These two KPIs directly indicate issues with how the system handles requests.  Other KPIs might be affected indirectly, but these are the primary indicators of failure.
* **Reason:** The combination of reduced success rate and altered request volume points to a problem in the code or configuration related to processing requests. SCWARN's anomaly detection further reinforces this conclusion.
* **Solution:** The suggested steps involve:
    * Reverting the change as a first step to restore functionality.
    * A thorough code review to identify the specific issue introduced by the change.
    * Analyzing logs for clues about the nature of the errors or unexpected behavior.
    * Closely monitoring KPIs after implementing a fix to ensure the problem is resolved.

	"reason": "The metrics 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' show deviations after the change.  'request_success_rate' indicates a decrease in success rate, while 'request_count' shows an upward trend that might be indicative of increased resource contention.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The observed anomalies in 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' strongly suggest a failure.  Decreased success rates often point to issues with the software's ability to process requests correctly, while increased request counts can indicate resource contention or other performance problems.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We are only provided with two distinct anomalies: 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'.  Therefore, these are the primary KPIs responsible for flagging this change as a failure.
* **Reason:** The data clearly shows a drop in request success rate and a rise in request count after the change. This combination suggests that the software is struggling to handle requests efficiently, potentially due to bugs introduced by the update or increased load on the system.
* **Solution:**  The proposed solution involves a systematic approach:

    1. **Code Review:** Examine the recent code changes for potential errors or unintended consequences. 
    2. **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize logs for error messages, warnings, or patterns that emerged after the change. This can pinpoint specific problem areas.
    3. **Performance Monitoring:** Continue monitoring key metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic to understand resource utilization and identify bottlenecks.


4. **Roll Back (If Necessary):** If the issue cannot be quickly resolved through debugging and code fixes, a rollback to the previous stable version might be necessary to restore normal service.
