	"reason": "The metrics 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations after the change.  'request_duration'  exhibits a much larger range with negative values post-change, indicating potential processing errors or delays. Similarly, 'request_count' shows a compressed range and negative minimum values, suggesting reduced request volume or unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Review code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made during the change to identify potential issues causing the abnormal metrics. 2. **Log analysis:** Analyze logs for errors, warnings, or unusual patterns around the time of the anomalies. 3. **Monitoring and alerting:**  Increase monitoring frequency and set up alerts for these key metrics to proactively detect future deviations."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided data clearly indicates a failure because both 'request_duration' and 'request_count' exhibit abnormal behavior post-change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We prioritize the two most impacted KPIs: 'request_duration' and 'request_count'. While other anomalies might exist, these directly affect core service functionality.
* **Reason for Failure:** The reason stems from the significant changes in these KPIs. Negative values in 'request_duration' suggest processing issues, while a compressed range in 'request_count' points to unexpected request volume fluctuations.
* **Solution:**

    1. **Code Review:**  A thorough review of the code changes is crucial to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. 
    2. **Log Analysis:** Logs can reveal errors, warnings, or unusual events correlating with the abnormal metrics. This helps in understanding the context of the issue.
    3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implementing more frequent monitoring and setting up alerts for these KPIs will allow for quicker detection of future deviations, enabling faster response and mitigation.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.  The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration.

}
``` 


**Explanation of the Analysis:**

* **Significant KPI Changes:** The change in 'request_duration' (increase in maximum value and trend shift) and 'request_count' (decrease in range and trend shift) strongly suggest a problem.  These KPIs are fundamental to understanding how your service performs.
* **Data Range Shifts:** The vast difference between the data ranges before and after the change is alarming. It points to a major disruption in normal behavior.
* **Possible Causes:** 
    * **Code Errors:** A bug introduced during development could be causing the performance issues.
    * **Configuration Mistakes:** Incorrect settings or misconfigurations might lead to resource inefficiencies or unexpected service behavior.

**Important Note:**  The provided data is limited. To give more specific advice, we'd need additional information like:

* **Timestamp of the change:** This helps pinpoint when the problem started.
* **Detailed logs:** Server logs, application logs, and any relevant system events can provide valuable clues about what went wrong.
* **Deployment details:**  Knowing how the change was deployed (e.g., a hot fix, a full server restart) might shed light on potential issues.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The significant shift in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' indicates a problem with the service.  The wide range in 'request_duration' suggests potential slowdowns or errors, while the decrease in 'request_count' might indicate issues with the service being accessed.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: "request_duration, request_count" are the primary KPIs showing anomalies.
* **reason**: The provided data clearly shows a divergence from normal behavior in these key performance indicators, pointing to a failure.
* **solution**:  A structured approach is suggested: review recent code changes, analyze logs for clues, investigate the mentioned incident, consider rolling back changes, and monitor the system closely after implementing solutions.

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided data, the change can be classified as a "failure".  Here's why:

* **Significant KPI Shifts:** The metrics `request_duration` and `request_count` show drastic shifts in their ranges after the change. This indicates a substantial impact on the system's performance.
* **Unexpected Trends:**  The increase in `request_duration` (suggesting slower response times) and decrease in `request_count` (indicating fewer requests being handled) are concerning and point to potential problems with the implemented changes.

**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear failure.  Here's why:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` exhibit abnormal behavior post-change. Increased latency (`request_duration`) directly impacts user experience, while the decrease in `request_count` might signal a problem with the service itself.
* **Lack of Contextual Information:** The analysis lacks details about the nature of the change (e.g., bug fix, feature addition). This context could shed light on whether the observed deviations are expected side effects or genuine failures. 

**Important Note:** While the data points to a failure, further investigation is crucial to pinpoint the root cause and implement an appropriate solution.

	"reason": "The metrics 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations after the change.  'request_duration' experiences a sudden increase in maximum value and a shift in overall trend from down to up. 'request_count' exhibits a decrease in its minimum value and a shift in overall trend from up to down. These anomalies suggest that the change negatively impacted system performance, potentially leading to increased latency and decreased throughput.",

Analyze logs for any errors or warnings that might provide clues about the cause of these anomalies. Consider rolling back the change or implementing a temporary fix while further investigation is conducted."

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": null,
	"reason": "While there are some changes in the 'request_duration' and 'request_count' metrics after the change, these remain within expected bounds and do not indicate a failure. Additionally, no anomalies were flagged by the SCWARN algorithm. The absence of significant deviations from historical norms suggests the change was implemented successfully.",
	"solution": null
}
``` 



Let me explain my reasoning:

* **KPI Analysis:**  Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show changes after the update, but these are not dramatic shifts outside of normal operating ranges. The trends also indicate fluctuations rather than consistent negative impacts. 
* **Absence of Anomalies:** The SCWARN algorithm didn't flag any anomalies. This is a strong indicator that the change didn't introduce unexpected or harmful behavior.

**Important Note:**  While this analysis suggests a successful change, continuous monitoring is always crucial. Keep an eye on these KPIs and any other relevant metrics to ensure the system remains stable and performs as expected over time.
