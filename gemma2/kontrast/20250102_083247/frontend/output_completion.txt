Let me explain my reasoning:

* **The prompt states:** "This set of data has been tested, and all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal." This directly tells us the change type is "normal".

* **Since it's a normal change**, there are no abnormal KPIs to list. 
*  **The solution section is left blank** because there are no issues to solve.

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`:** The provided data clearly shows significant deviations from previous trends in several KPIs, indicating a potential system failure.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`:**  The selection prioritizes KPIs showing the most dramatic changes and likely impacting overall system health:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp drop suggests issues with service communication or reliability within Istio.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency is a major performance indicator, potentially causing slowdowns and user dissatisfaction.
    * `memory_usage`: High memory consumption can lead to system instability and resource contention. 
    * `net_send_packet` and `cpu_usage`: While less severe than the others, their increases contribute to the overall picture of system strain.
* **`reason`:**  The explanation focuses on the observed KPI changes and their potential implications for Istio's functionality and performance.

* **`solution`:** The suggested solutions address the identified problems directly:
    1. Root cause analysis for the `istio_success_rate` drop.
    2. Optimization of routing and configuration within Istio to improve `istio_duration`.
    3. Memory leak detection and resource management strategies to control `memory_usage`.

	"reason": "A significant drop in istio_success_rate and memory_usage indicates potential performance issues. Additionally, changes in istio_duration, net_send_packet, and cpu_usage suggest resource contention or increased load.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased success rate for Istio requests. Analyze memory consumption patterns and optimize resource allocation. Monitor CPU usage and network traffic to identify bottlenecks. Consider scaling resources or optimizing application code to improve performance."
}
``` 


Let me explain the reasoning behind this classification:

* **Failure Indication:** The `istio_success_rate` dropping significantly points to a problem with how Istio is handling requests, which could be due to configuration issues, network problems, or even underlying service issues.  
* **Resource Concerns:** The drop in `memory_usage` and the change in `cpu_usage` and `net_send_packet` suggest that the system may be struggling with resource management. It's possible that the application is consuming more resources than expected or that there are bottlenecks in the network or server infrastructure.
* **Istio Duration:** The increase in `istio_duration` indicates that requests are taking longer to process, which could be a symptom of any of the issues mentioned above.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_send_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The metrics for 'istio_success_rate', 'istio_duration', 'net_send_packet', 'memory_usage', and 'cpu_usage' show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' has a drastically reduced minimum value, indicating potential issues with request completion. 'istio_duration' exhibits a much wider range and a downward trend in average duration, suggesting performance bottlenecks. The other KPIs also show increased variability or shifts in their ranges, hinting at instability caused by the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this period. Pay close attention to any modifications related to network communication, resource management (memory and CPU), and service interaction with Istio.  Monitor logs and system performance metrics for further clues about the root cause of these deviations. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing temporary mitigations while debugging the issue."
