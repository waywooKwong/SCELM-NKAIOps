}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show a clear deviation from the normal behavior. This indicates a problem introduced by the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The most significant deviations are in `istio_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `net_send_packet`, and `net_recv_packet`. These KPIs point to increased resource consumption and network activity, suggesting a potential issue with the deployed code.
* **reason:**  The provided data clearly indicates that resource usage (CPU, memory) has increased significantly after the change. Network traffic metrics also show abnormal behavior. This suggests a problem within the application or its configuration.
* **solution:** The suggested solution involves:

    1. **Code Review:** Analyze the recent code changes to pinpoint the source of the increased resource consumption and network activity. 
    2. **Component Optimization:** Identify the specific components responsible for the spikes and optimize their performance. This might involve refactoring code, using more efficient algorithms, or reducing unnecessary operations.
    3. **Resource Scaling:** If optimization alone is insufficient, consider scaling up resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to accommodate the increased demand. 
    4. **Monitoring:**  Implement continuous monitoring of these KPIs after implementing any changes. This will help you track the effectiveness of your solutions and detect any new issues promptly.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The data clearly shows negative impacts on key metrics like istio duration, CPU/memory usage, and network throughput after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These KPIs are selected based on their severity and direct impact on system performance and resource consumption.
* **reason:**  A concise explanation is provided, linking the observed changes to potential causes (performance issues, resource contention, communication bottlenecks).
* **solution:**  Actionable steps are suggested to address the failure, including code review, profiling, and network analysis.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure** - The provided data clearly shows anomalies in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This suggests a negative impact on system health and functionality.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The most impactful KPIs with significant changes are selected.
* **reason:** A concise explanation linking the observed KPI deviations to potential failure scenarios like resource contention or unexpected workload is provided.
* **solution:** General guidance is given to address the potential issue, focusing on investigation, root cause analysis, and potential mitigation strategies.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Indicator Data Within Threshold:** The provided data states that all indicator data falls within defined thresholds. This means there are no significant deviations or spikes suggesting a problem.
* **Absence of Negative Impact:** There's no mention of any negative consequences resulting from the change (e.g., performance degradation, errors).

Therefore, based on the available information, the change appears to be normal and functioning as expected.

``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates that none of the KPIs exceeded their thresholds after the change.  All values fall within expected ranges. Therefore:

* **`change_type`**: "normal" because the data shows no signs of failure or negative impact.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**: Null because there are no abnormal KPIs.
* **`reason`**:  Clearly states that the data is normal as per the defined thresholds.
* **`solution`**: Not applicable since there's no issue to solve.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_usage, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  `istio_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `net_send_packet`, and `net_recv_packet` all exhibit increased ranges and shifts in their mean values, suggesting a potential strain on system resources.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the nature of the change:** Determine precisely what was modified and how it might be impacting these KPIs.\n2. **Monitor resource consumption closely:**  Continuously track CPU, memory, and network usage to identify patterns and bottlenecks.\n3. **Optimize application performance:** Analyze the code for inefficiencies and potential areas for optimization.\n4. **Scale resources if necessary:** Consider increasing server capacity or adjusting configuration settings to accommodate the increased load."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The data clearly indicates a negative impact after the change. KPIs are significantly different from their pre-change values, pointing to a system issue.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We list the most affected KPIs – those showing the largest deviations and potential strain on the system.  
* **reason:** The explanation connects the observed KPI changes to potential resource issues, highlighting the cause for concern.
* **solution:**  The suggested steps provide a structured approach to troubleshooting and resolving the problem:

    1. **Identify the root cause:** Understand what change triggered the issue. 2. **Continuous monitoring:** Keep a close eye on resource usage to pinpoint problems.
    3. **Code optimization:** Improve application efficiency to reduce resource demands. 4. **Scaling:** Adjust system capacity if needed to handle the increased load.
