{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in memory usage, CPU usage, and istio_duration metrics after the change. Memory and CPU usage decreased, while istio_duration increased, suggesting potential resource contention or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes that were implemented to identify the root cause of the altered resource consumption. Optimize the code for efficiency, consider scaling resources if necessary, and monitor the metrics closely after implementing any changes."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPI data shows significant negative changes in memory usage and CPU usage, which are crucial system resources. The increase in istio_duration further indicates potential performance issues.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The most impactful KPIs are:
    * `memory_usage`: Decreased significantly, suggesting a potential memory leak or inefficient memory allocation.
    * `cpu_usage`: Also decreased significantly, indicating that the application might not be utilizing CPU resources effectively after the change.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, implying that communication between services within the system is taking longer.

* **reason:**  The combined effect of these KPI changes strongly suggests a problem with the implemented changes. 

* **solution:** A thorough investigation into the code changes is crucial to pinpoint the exact cause. Possible solutions include:
    * Code optimization to reduce memory consumption and CPU load.
    * Scaling resources (e.g., adding more servers) if the application's workload demands it.
    * Analyzing network traffic patterns to identify bottlenecks and optimize communication between services.
