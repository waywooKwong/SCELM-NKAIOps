{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, net_send_packet, cpu_usage, istio_duration, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key metrics like istio_count and net_send_packet indicate a potential service disruption or increased load. CPU usage also shows an abnormal spike. These changes suggest the change might be causing performance issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the recent changes made to the service and identify the root cause of the increased resource consumption. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing optimizations to improve performance."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure** - The provided data clearly shows anomalies in several critical metrics, indicating a potential problem introduced by the change. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  We list the KPIs with the most significant deviations after the change. Remember that "build" is likely excluded as it's usually not a core operational metric.
* **reason:** The explanation connects the observed anomalies to possible causes (e.g., increased load, service disruption). It's important to be specific about *why* these changes are concerning.
* **solution:**  This provides actionable steps to address the failure. Investigating the recent changes and potentially rolling them back or implementing optimizations are common approaches.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "The data shows a significant decrease in cpu_usage and an increase in istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet after the change. This indicates potential resource contention or increased network traffic which might be causing performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the cause of the increased resource utilization and network traffic. Optimize application code to reduce CPU usage and network requests.  Consider scaling up resources if necessary."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type**: "failure" because the metrics indicate a negative change after the update.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: These KPIs show the most significant deviations from their pre-change values, suggesting they are key contributors to the observed issue.  
* **reason**: The decrease in CPU usage and increase in other network-related metrics point to potential inefficiencies or bottlenecks introduced by the change.
* **solution**: This provides a starting point for troubleshooting and addressing the problem. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause and implement targeted solutions.
