``` 


Let me break down why I classified this change as a "failure":

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The  `request_duration` and `request_count` KPIs show drastic changes after the modification. While it's normal for metrics to fluctuate, the magnitude and direction of these shifts suggest a problem. 
* **Negative Impact:** A sudden decrease in `request_count` usually means fewer users are interacting with the service, which could point to problems with availability or functionality.  A widening range in `request_duration` indicates inconsistencies in how long requests take to complete, potentially due to bottlenecks or errors.

**Important Next Steps:**

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Dive deeper into logs and monitoring data around the time of the change to pinpoint the exact cause of these KPI deviations.
2. **Code Review:** Scrutinize recent code changes for potential bugs or unintended consequences that might be affecting the service's performance.
3. **Rollback:** If the issue is severe and impacting users, consider rolling back the recent change while investigating the root cause.

Let me break down why this change is classified as "normal" based on your provided information:

* **KPI Data:** The key metric here is that both `request_duration` and `request_count` show changes in their ranges before and after the change. However,  these are *within* expected operational bounds and don't point to a drastic negative shift. 
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Your system flags no anomalies, which further supports the conclusion that there were no significant performance problems introduced by the change.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:** It's crucial to understand what constitutes an "abnormal" deviation for your specific KPIs. Your thresholds should be set based on historical data and expected performance levels.
* **Context:**  Even if changes are within thresholds, it's important to consider the *context* of the change. Was this a small tweak or a major overhaul? The context might influence how you interpret the KPI changes.

* **Trend Analysis:** While there are changes in trends between pre-change and post-change, these are generally within expected ranges of fluctuation and don't signal a catastrophic issue.

**Important Note:**

This analysis relies solely on the provided data. A more comprehensive evaluation would involve:

* **Historical Context:** Comparing the change with historical performance baselines for a richer understanding.
* **Log Analysis:** Investigating the "newly generated log pattern" mentioned to identify if it reflects any potential problems.
* **Application-Specific Metrics:** Depending on the service ("currencypage"), there might be other crucial KPIs not listed that need to be considered.

``` 



Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Significant Data Shifts:** The data for `request_duration` and `request_count` show substantial changes in their ranges and trends after the change. This indicates a problem, especially since these KPIs are crucial for system performance.
* **Negative Impact:**  The increase in `request_duration` suggests slower response times, which can negatively impact user experience. The decrease in `request_count` might indicate issues with requests being processed or served correctly.

**Why the "failure" classification?**


While more investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause, the magnitude and direction of these KPI changes strongly suggest a problem introduced by the change. This warrants classifying it as a failure until further analysis reveals otherwise.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  While the data only provides two primary anomalies ('request_duration' and 'request_count'), focusing on these is crucial for initial investigation.
* **Reason:** The drastic changes in KPI values point to the change negatively impacting service performance. The increased request duration could indicate slow response times, while the decreased request count might suggest issues with requests failing or being dropped.
* **Solution:** A systematic approach is needed:
    1. **Code Review:**  Carefully examine the code changes made during this period to pinpoint where things went wrong.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Analyze logs around the anomaly timestamps for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that might shed light on the problem.
    3. **Rollback (Temporary):** Consider reverting the change as a temporary measure while investigating the root cause to restore service stability.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_duration' and 'request_count'. The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration.  The 'request_duration' shows an increase in maximum value and a shift in the overall trend from down to up, while 'request_count' shows a decrease in both minimum and maximum values and a shift in the overall trend from down to down.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Investigate the 'Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' incident:** This specific incident might be directly related to the observed changes. Determine the impact of this incident on 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.\n4. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify any bottlenecks or resource contention that could be contributing to the performance degradation. \n5. **Roll back the change:** If possible, temporarily revert the changes made to the system to see if it resolves the anomalies. This can help isolate the root cause of the issue."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear failure. Here's why:

* **Significant Data Range Shifts:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show drastic changes in their minimum, maximum, and mean values after the change. This suggests a major impact on the system's performance.
* **Trend Changes:** The shift from a downward trend to an upward trend in `request_duration` is concerning, indicating potential slowdowns or increased processing times.
* **Relationship to Incident:** The mention of the "Deleting White List" incident raises suspicion that it might be directly responsible for the observed anomalies. 

The suggested solution steps aim to:

1.  **Identify the root cause:** By reviewing code changes, logs, and investigating the incident's impact.
2. **Address resource issues:** Check for bottlenecks that could be exacerbating the problem.
3. **Temporarily revert changes:** To isolate the issue and potentially restore functionality.
