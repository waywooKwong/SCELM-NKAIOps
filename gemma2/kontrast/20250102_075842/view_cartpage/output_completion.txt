**Explanation of the "failure" classification:**

*  The `request_success_rate` dropping to 0 indicates a complete failure in processing requests. This alone strongly suggests a critical issue.
* The shift in `request_count` trends, while less severe, also points to a disruption in normal request handling patterns.

}
``` 



Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No Critical Deviations:**  The analysis states that KPIs remain within historical norms. There's no mention of significant deviations or disruptions in system performance.

* **Limited Anomalies:** Only two anomaly description shapes were identified, and the overall number of anomalies is reported as 1. This suggests minor fluctuations rather than a systemic issue caused by the change.
* **SCWARN Algorithm:** The absence of critical flags from the SCWARN algorithm reinforces the idea that the change did not introduce major problems.

**Important Note:** While this analysis points to a normal change, continuous monitoring is crucial. Even small deviations can sometimes escalate over time.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: "failure" because the 'request_success_rate' dropped to 0, indicating a significant problem with the service's ability to handle requests successfully.  
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  I am listing only two KPIs as per your instructions:
    * `request_count`: Shows a slight increase which could be normal but needs further investigation in context.
    * `request_success_rate`: Dropped to 0, this is the primary indicator of failure. 
* **Reason**: The combination of flagged anomalies and the drastic decrease in 'request_success_rate' points to a serious issue. The service might be failing to process requests correctly.
* **Solution**:  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the 'request_success_rate' drop.

**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates minimal deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) before and after the change.  While the SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies at specific timestamps, these are isolated incidents and don't suggest a systemic issue impacting overall system performance. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Limited KPI Impact:** The 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' KPIs remained within acceptable ranges.
* **Zero Overall Anomalies:** The total number of anomalies found was zero, further suggesting that the change didn't cause widespread disruptions.
* **Single Anomalous KPI:** Only one KPI showed anomalous behavior, which might be due to a minor fluctuation rather than a major failure.



**Therefore, based on these observations, the change is classified as 'normal'.**

}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Direct Indication of Failure:** The text  "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" is a very strong signal that the change was unsuccessful. It highlights critical problems with the software's setup and functionality. 
* **No Positive Indicators:** There's no mention of any positive changes or improvements in KPIs after the deployment.

Given these factors, classifying this change as "failure" is the only logical choice.  The suggested solution prioritizes mitigating the immediate issue by rolling back the faulty change and then focusing on a thorough investigation and resolution of the underlying problems.

	"reason": "The provided data indicates that there was a significant change in the 'request_count' KPI after the implementation. While the overall trend before the change was downwards, the post-change trend shows an upward shift. This suggests potential issues with the software changes or misconfigurations.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code commits:** Analyze the changes made to the view_cartpage service to identify any potential bugs or logic errors that could be causing an increased request count.\n2. **Monitor system logs:** Examine detailed logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns related to the cart page view requests.\n3. **Investigate resource usage:** Check if there's a sudden spike in CPU, memory, or network usage associated with the view_cartpage service after the change. This could indicate a performance bottleneck.\n4. **Roll back recent changes:** If possible, temporarily revert the recent changes to determine if they are indeed the cause of the issue."

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations from expected behavior.  Both 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' experienced anomalies after the change implementation. While the 'request_count' range shifted slightly, the most concerning issue is the 'request_success_rate' consistently dropping to 0. This indicates a complete failure in processing requests.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert to the previous state to restore functionality. \n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Examine the modifications made before the data shift for potential bugs, misconfigurations, or unintended side effects.  \n3. **Analyze system logs:** Investigate logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI deviations. \n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' to identify further anomalies or patterns. \n5. **Engage with relevant stakeholders:** Collaborate with developers, system administrators, and other relevant parties to diagnose the root cause and implement a solution."
