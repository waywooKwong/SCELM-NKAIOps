Let me explain my reasoning:

* **KPI Ranges:** The data you provided shows that all KPIs (memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration, net_send_packet, etc.)  fall within their typical ranges before and after the change. There are no spikes or sudden drops that would indicate a problem.
* **Trend Analysis:** While some KPIs show slight fluctuations in their minimum and maximum values, the overall trend remains consistent (mostly downward) both before and after the change. This suggests that the change did not have a significant negative impact on system performance. 

**Important Note:** Without specific thresholds or defined acceptable ranges for each KPI, it's difficult to definitively say if a value is "abnormal." However, based on the provided data, there's no clear evidence of failure.

Let me explain why this classification is appropriate:

* **No Threshold Exceeded:** The provided data doesn't indicate that any KPI value has exceeded a defined threshold, which would typically signal a problem.
* **Within Expected Ranges:**  The values for all KPIs fall within reasonable ranges, even though there might be some fluctuations. 
* **Absence of Trends:** While there are mentions of "trends" (up or down), these don't necessarily point to alarming issues unless they are accompanied by extreme values.


If you had provided data where certain KPIs were consistently exceeding thresholds or showing erratic behavior, the classification would have changed to "failure," and I would have suggested potential solutions based on the specific anomalies detected.

**Explanation:**
