	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.  Both KPIs exhibit shifted data ranges and trends. 'request_count' shows a wider range and a shift from an upward trend to an overall upward trend, while 'request_success_rate' demonstrates a decrease in both minimum and maximum values and a shift from an upward trend to a downward trend. These anomalies suggest potential malfunctions or misconfigurations.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects related to request handling and success rate calculations. \n2. **Analyze logs before and after the change:** Scrutinize system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI changes.

This can help identify ongoing issues or bottlenecks contributing to the anomalies."
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure. Here's why:

* **Shifting Trends:** Both `request_count` and `request_success_rate`  show significant changes in their trends after the change. This suggests a direct impact of the change on system behavior.
* **Wider Data Ranges:** The increased range for both KPIs points to more extreme values, indicating potential instability or issues with handling requests.

Gradually roll back changes if necessary to isolate the root cause."
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Significant Data Shifts:** The provided data shows substantial changes in both 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' after the change.  These shifts are outside the normal range observed before the change, indicating a problem.
* **Trend Changes:** The trends for both KPIs have changed after the modification. This suggests that the change has directly impacted how the system processes requests.
* **Lack of Other Anomaly Information:** While the provided data mentions total anomalies found and anomaly description shapes, it doesn't offer specific details about these anomalies. Without further information, we assume the impact on 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' is the primary concern. 



Let me know if you have any more context or details about the anomalies â€“ this could help refine the analysis and solution!

**Explanation:**

The analysis clearly states: "Total anomalies found: -1".  This indicates no anomalies were detected. Additionally, it says "Total number of anomalous kpis: 0" confirming that none of the KPIs deviated from expected behavior. The data shows a shift in trends for "request_count" and "request_success_rate" but these are presented as general shifts rather than abnormal spikes or dips.

Since no anomalies were detected and KPIs remained within normal ranges, classifying this change as "normal" is justified.

**Explanation:**

Based on your provided information:

* **Pre-Approved Process Adherence:**  We assume the process was followed since it's not stated otherwise.
* **Post-Change Metrics Comparison:** The data indicates that KPIs like `request_count` and `request_success_rate` did experience shifts, but these are within expected ranges. 
* **Impact Assessment:** There's no evidence of significant degradation in system performance or increased error rates. 
* **Anomaly Detection:**  The SCWARN algorithm didn't identify any anomalies, indicating normal behavior.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Normal:** The analysis states "Total anomalies found: -1", meaning no anomalies were detected.  The KPI changes described seem within a range that could be normal fluctuations.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Since there were no anomalies, this field remains empty.
* **Reason:**  The absence of significant deviations or anomalies in key metrics suggests the change did not negatively impact system performance. The slight shifts in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' could be attributed to various factors unrelated to the change itself and require further investigation.
* **Solution:** As no failure was identified, no specific solution is required at this time. Continued monitoring of these KPIs is recommended to ensure the system remains stable.
