**Explanation:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`**  The data clearly indicates a negative impact on system performance, making it a failure. 

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: `"request_success_rate", "request_count"`** These are the two KPIs that show significant and unexpected deviations after the change.

* **`reason`:** The reason statement  explains the observed anomalies in `request_success_rate` and `request_count`, linking them to a potential problem introduced by the recent changes. It also mentions the SCWARN algorithm's findings as further evidence of failure.

* **`solution`:** The proposed solutions are designed to address the identified issue:
    *  **Rollback:** Reverting changes is often the quickest way to restore stability. 
    *  **Code Review:** Carefully examining the code will help pinpoint the exact cause of the problem.
    *  **Log Analysis:** System logs can provide valuable clues about errors or unusual events.
    * **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure the issue is resolved and prevent its recurrence.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" 
    * The analysis states that KPIs remain within historical norms and there is no significant degradation in system performance.  The absence of major performance issues points to a successful change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPI:** Left blank because the provided data does not list any KPIs with significant deviations that would warrant classification as "failure".

* **Reason:** The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, but these are described as "single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies" and do not exceed thresholds considered abnormal. 
    *  The metrics 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' show minor fluctuations, but their ranges remain consistent with pre-change data.

* **Solution:** Not applicable since the change is classified as "normal". No corrective actions are needed based on the available information.

**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure:

* **Decreased 'request_success_rate':** This strongly suggests problems with how the system handles requests, leading to more failures.
* **Unusual increase in 'request_count':**  While it might seem counterintuitive, this could indicate the system is trying to compensate for failed requests by making more attempts.
* **SCWARN algorithm flagging anomalies:** This automated system confirms that the data shows unusual behavior beyond just simple fluctuations.

Based on these factors, classifying the change as a "failure" is appropriate. The suggested solutions focus on identifying the root cause (likely within recent code changes) and taking corrective actions, including potentially rolling back to a stable state.

**Explanation:**

*   **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs `request_success_rate` dropping to a negative value and the shift in `request_count` strongly indicate a problem.
*   **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We list `request_success_rate` and `request_count` as the primary issues.
*   **Reason:**  The reason clearly states that the KPIs show clear signs of failure, with negative values for success rate and unusual trends in request count. The SCWARN algorithm further supports this conclusion.
*   **Solution:** The solution focuses on:
    *   Reverting the recent changes to restore functionality.
    *   Analyzing code and logs to pinpoint the cause.
    *   Monitoring systems for ongoing impacts.
    *   Collaborating with developers for a fix.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The metrics directly indicate a problem. Request success rates dropping and request counts fluctuating strongly suggest a negative impact on the service.  

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We are focusing on the most critical indicators:
    * `request_success_rate`: A significant decrease means the system is failing to respond or process requests correctly.
    * `request_count`: Fluctuations could indicate errors causing retries or unexpected behavior, putting additional strain on the system.

* **Reason:** The change introduced issues directly related to IP address configuration and software defects, as highlighted in the initial data.  This aligns with the observed metric changes.

* **Solution:** A targeted investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact problem within the code:
    * **Network Configuration:** Verify IP address assignments are correct for all relevant services and components.
    * **Software Logic:** Review the code changes made to identify any flaws in how IP addresses are handled or used, leading to errors.

	"solution": "1. **Review the recent code changes**: Identify the specific changes related to the `productpage` service and analyze them for potential bugs or logic errors that could be impacting request success rates. \n2. **Investigate configuration issues**: Check if any incorrect configurations were introduced during the change process, affecting how requests are handled by the service.\n3. **Monitor logs for errors**: Analyze logs from the `productpage` service to identify any error messages or patterns that correlate with the decrease in request success rates.\n4. **Rollback the changes**: If possible, temporarily rollback the recent changes to revert to a stable state and investigate further."
