	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_send_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  istio_success_rate dropped sharply, istio_duration increased substantially, and both net_send_packet and memory_usage exhibit wider ranges indicating potential instability. CPU usage also saw a decrease which could point to an inefficiency.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The significant drops in `istio_success_rate` and increases in `istio_duration` strongly suggest a problem with the service mesh (Istio) after the change.  This, combined with other unstable KPIs, points to a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: These are the KPIs that show the most dramatic changes, indicating potential critical issues.
* **reason**: The explanation provides a clear and concise summary of the problems observed in the data.
* **solution**:  The suggested solutions are actionable steps to address the identified issues.

**Explanation:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`** -  The data clearly shows a negative impact on several key metrics, suggesting the change introduced problems.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**: These KPIs are selected based on the magnitude and direction of their changes, indicating potential core issues:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests problems with network communication or service health within Istio.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased range and decreased average could indicate slowdowns or inconsistencies in request handling within Istio.
    * `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`:  Changes in these point to potential resource contention or inefficiencies within the application.
* **`reason`**: This provides a concise explanation based on the observed KPI deviations, highlighting possible areas of concern (network, resources, performance).
* **`solution`**:  The suggested steps are focused on diagnosing the root cause and mitigating the issue:
    * Code review to identify potential errors introduced by recent changes.
    * Log analysis for error messages related to network, memory, or CPU issues.
    * Application profiling to pinpoint where resource consumption is excessive.
    * Rolling back changes if they are clearly responsible for the problems.

	"reason": "The `istio_success_rate`  significantly decreased after the change, indicating potential issues with request handling.  Additionally,  `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, and `istio_duration` show unusual fluctuations suggesting increased system load or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the reasons behind the drop in `istio_success_rate`. Analyze logs and monitor system resources (CPU, memory) to identify bottlenecks. Consider scaling infrastructure or optimizing application code for improved performance."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  We classify this as a "failure" because several KPIs show significant deviations from their previous behavior. This strongly suggests that the change introduced problems.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We list the KPIs with the most concerning changes:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A large drop indicates service disruptions or failures.
    *  `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, and `istio_duration`: These show unusual increases, suggesting a strain on system resources.

* **Reason:** We provide a concise explanation based on the data: The change appears to have negatively impacted request handling (`istio_success_rate`), and overall system performance is suffering due to increased resource consumption. 

* **Solution:** We offer actionable steps:
    * **Diagnose `istio_success_rate` drop:**  Examine logs, error messages, and application code for the root cause of this decline.
    * **Monitor Resources:** Closely track CPU, memory, and network usage to pinpoint bottlenecks. 
    * **Scale/Optimize:** If resource constraints are identified, consider scaling up infrastructure (e.g., adding more servers) or optimizing application code to reduce its resource footprint.

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all indicator values remain within established thresholds, suggesting no significant deviations or failures.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

The output adheres to the requested JSON schema and reflects the analysis of the input data.  Here's a breakdown:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`**:  Since all KPI values are within acceptable ranges, the change is classified as "normal."

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A"`**: This field remains empty because no KPIs exceeded their thresholds.

* **`"reason"`**: This field provides a concise explanation based on the data:  All indicator values fall within acceptable limits.

* **`"solution"`**: This field is left as "N/A" since there are no issues to address.
