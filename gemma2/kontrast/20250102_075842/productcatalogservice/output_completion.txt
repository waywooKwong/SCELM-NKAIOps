{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration",
	"reason": "There's a significant shift in memory usage (downward), CPU usage (increased range), and  istio_duration (increased range) after the change. These indicate potential resource strain or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this period. Look for areas that might be consuming more resources (memory, CPU) or causing increased latency in Istio communication. Optimize these areas to bring resource consumption back within acceptable limits."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The observed KPI changes point towards a negative impact, warranting a classification as "failure".

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  We list the three most concerning KPIs:
    * **memory_usage:** A downward trend could mean memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    * **cpu_usage:** Increased range suggests higher CPU load, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
    * **istio_duration:** Higher ranges in Istio durations indicate increased latency within the service mesh, which can affect application responsiveness.

* **reason:**  The provided KPIs clearly demonstrate a shift towards resource strain and potential performance degradation. 

* **solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of these issues through code review and optimization.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, memory_usage, istio_count, diskio",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in CPU usage (up), memory usage (down),  istio_count (up), and diskio (up) after the change indicate a potential performance issue or resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the reasons behind the increased CPU and istio_count, and decreased memory usage. Analyze resource utilization patterns and optimize resource allocation to address potential bottlenecks."
}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning:

* **CPU Usage (up):**  A sharp increase in CPU usage suggests that the system is working harder than before. This could be due to increased workload, inefficient code execution, or a bug consuming resources.
* **Memory Usage (down):** A decrease in memory usage might seem positive initially, but it could indicate that processes are being starved of memory, leading to performance degradation and potential errors.  
* **Istio Count (up):** An increase in Istio calls suggests higher traffic or a change in how services interact. While this isn't necessarily bad, if coupled with CPU increases, it points to a potential strain on your service mesh infrastructure.
* **DiskIO (up):**  Increased disk I/O can indicate slow storage performance or excessive read/write operations. This could be caused by inefficient database queries or log file management.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any specific point!

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Change Type:** The changes in `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `istio_duration`, `diskio`, and `istio_count` indicate a potential failure or instability introduced by the change.
* **Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs are highlighted as they show the most significant deviations from their pre-change behavior.  
* **Reason:** The provided metrics clearly suggest a negative impact. 
    * Decreasing `memory_usage` could be due to processes being terminated unexpectedly or inefficient memory management.
    * Increased `cpu_usage` points to a potential performance bottleneck.
    * Spikes in `istio_duration` and `istio_count` might indicate issues with service mesh communication or configuration. 
    * The decrease in `diskio` could be related to less I/O activity, but requires further investigation.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting:
    * **Resource Contention:** Examine if the change is causing conflicts for resources like CPU, memory, or disk I/O.
    * **Logging and Monitoring:** Analyze system logs and performance metrics to pinpoint the exact cause of the issues in `istio_duration` and `istio_count`.
    * **Resource Allocation:** If resource contention is confirmed, adjust resource allocation (e.g., CPU cores, memory limits) for affected services or processes.

	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change. CPU usage decreased sharply, while memory usage, disk IO, and istio metrics increased. This suggests a potential resource contention issue or misconfiguration.",
	"solution": "Investigate the reasons behind the changes in CPU and memory usage. Analyze the logs for any error messages or performance bottlenecks related to Istio. Review the configuration settings for the affected services and identify potential areas for optimization."
