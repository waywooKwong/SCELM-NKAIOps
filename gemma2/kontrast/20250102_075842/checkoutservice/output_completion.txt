Let me explain the reasoning behind this output:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`**  Since the provided data indicates that no indicator data exceeded its threshold, we classify this change as "normal".

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`: null** Because there were no abnormal KPIs, this field remains empty.

* **`reason`: "All indicator data is within the defined threshold."** This clearly states the basis for our classification: all monitored metrics stayed below their acceptable limits.

* **`solution`: null**  As there's no issue to solve, a solution is not required in this case.

Let me break down why:

* **change_type:**  The provided data shows that none of the KPIs exceed their thresholds after the change. This indicates the change did not result in abnormal performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Since there are no KPIs exceeding thresholds, this field is left empty (null).

* **solution:** A solution is unnecessary when there is no failure to address.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": " istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_duration, diskio",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' drops dramatically, indicating issues with request completion. 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet'  show decreased values, suggesting network problems. 'istio_duration' increases, implying slower processing times. Finally, 'diskio' reaches zero, potentially signaling a disk access problem.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'istio_success_rate' drop. Check network connectivity and server performance related to 'net_send_packet', 'net_recv_packet', and 'istio_duration'.  Examine disk usage and configuration to address the 'diskio' issue."

Let me break down why this response is formatted that way:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`** -  The provided data indicates that KPI values are within acceptable ranges. There's no evidence of a significant deviation or negative impact on system performance. 

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi": ""`** - Since the change type is "normal", there are no KPIs flagged as abnormally high or low.

* **`"reason"`:** This explanation clearly states why the change is classified as normal.

* **`"solution": ""`** -  A solution isn't needed because the system isn't experiencing a failure.
