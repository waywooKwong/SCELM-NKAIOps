**Explanation of the Classification:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" 
    * The provided KPI data clearly shows negative changes after the submission.
    *  `istio_duration` and `istio_success_rate` both indicate a decline in performance.
    *  `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, and `net_recv_packet`  show abnormal increases, suggesting resource contention.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    *  `istio_duration`: Increased latency in service calls.
    *  `istio_success_rate`:  Decrease in successful service call completion.
    *  `cpu_usage`:  Higher CPU utilization, potentially indicating a performance bottleneck.
    *  `memory_usage`: Increased memory consumption, which can lead to slowdowns.
    *  `net_recv_packet`:  Higher network packet reception, potentially due to increased traffic or inefficient communication.

* **Reason:** The combination of performance degradation (`istio_duration`, `istio_success_rate`) and resource consumption issues (`cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `net_recv_packet`) strongly suggests the change introduced a bug or inefficiency that negatively impacted the service.

* **Solution:**
    * **Investigation:**  Thoroughly review the code changes made during the submission period.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine logs around the time of the anomaly to identify error messages or patterns that might point to the cause.
    * **Performance Monitoring:** Continue to monitor KPIs closely to track the impact of any solutions implemented.
    * **Rollback:** If the issue is severe and the impact is significant, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous state.
    * **Mitigation:** If a rollback is not feasible, implement strategies to mitigate the performance degradation, such as optimizing resource usage, improving code efficiency, or adjusting network configurations.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, indicating slower request processing.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased, suggesting more failed requests.
    * `cpu_usage`:  Shifted, potentially indicating increased resource consumption.
    * `memory_usage`: Shifted, potentially indicating increased memory pressure.
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased, possibly related to the performance issues.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to a performance degradation after the change. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on root cause analysis and potential performance tuning strategies.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **istio_success_rate:** A sharp decrease indicates potential issues with service requests being successfully processed.
    * **cpu_usage:** A drop in CPU usage might seem positive, but in this context, it could suggest underutilized resources or a problem with the service's workload.
    * **memory_usage:** Similar to CPU usage, a decrease could point to a problem with resource allocation or the service's memory management.
    * **net_recv_packet:** A decrease in received network packets suggests potential communication issues or reduced traffic flow.
    * **istio_duration:** A significant increase indicates that requests are taking longer to process, leading to potential latency problems.

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced issues within the service, impacting its performance and reliability.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to troubleshooting the problem:
    * **Review Change Logs:** Identify the specific changes made and their potential impact on the service.
    * **Monitor Resource Usage:** Analyze CPU, memory, and network resource utilization to pinpoint bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
    * **Analyze Network Traffic:** Examine network traffic patterns to identify potential communication issues or congestion points.
    * **Optimize Code:** Review the service's code for potential performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
    * **Scale Resources:** If necessary, increase the allocated resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to handle the service's workload.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" 
    * The metrics clearly show a negative impact after the change. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  "istio_duration", "istio_success_rate", and "memory_usage" are the most concerning KPIs.
    *  Decreased "istio_duration" and "istio_success_rate" point to slower processing and potential failures in handling requests.
    * Increased "memory_usage" suggests the service is consuming more resources, which could lead to performance degradation or instability.
* **Reason:** The provided data directly supports the classification of "failure." The KPIs demonstrate a clear downward trend in performance and an increase in resource usage after the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issues by reviewing the code changes and logs.  It also proposes potential remedies like rolling back the changes or optimizing the code for better performance.
