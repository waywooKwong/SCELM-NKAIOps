{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPI values remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations suggesting disruptions or performance degradation.  The SCWARN algorithm also identified anomalies, but these are not considered major failures based on the context.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: normal** -  The analysis states that KPIs remain within historical norms, and there are no significant performance issues. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi: N/A** - Since the change type is classified as "normal," there are no top abnormal KPIs to list.
* **reason:** The provided data and analysis indicate a normal change. While anomalies were detected by the SCWARN algorithm, they are not severe enough to classify the change as a failure.
* **solution:**  No solution is needed because the change is not considered a failure.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the submission.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs are experiencing the most significant deviations from their expected behavior.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly indicates a decline in 'istio_success_rate' and unexpected increases in 'diskio' and 'memory_usage'. The wider ranges in 'net_send_packet' and 'istio_duration' suggest instability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issue through code review and log analysis.  Rolling back or implementing a staged rollout are common strategies to mitigate the impact of a failed change.
