**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The substantial changes in KPIs like 'istio_success_rate', 'istio_count', 'net_send_packet', 'memory_usage', and 'istio_duration' point to a negative impact from the change.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs show the most significant deviations from pre-change behavior.

* **Reason:** The provided data clearly indicates performance degradation in key areas:
    * **'istio_success_rate'**: A sharp drop suggests problems with service communication.
    * **'istio_count' and 'net_send_packet'**: Increased volatility indicates potential issues with message exchange or network connectivity.
    * **'memory_usage'**: A decrease could mean the service isn't utilizing its allocated resources effectively, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
    * **'istio_duration'**: A wider range suggests inconsistent response times, affecting service responsiveness.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Investigation:**  Understanding the nature of the changes made and identifying the root cause of the anomalies.
    * **Reversal:** If possible, reverting the changes to restore previous performance levels.
    * **Fixes:** Implementing targeted solutions to address the identified issues in service communication, resource utilization, and network performance.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The provided data shows no significant degradation in system performance. KPIs like `net_recv_packet`, `istio_count`, `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, and `istio_duration`  display changes in trends but remain within expected ranges. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Not applicable because there are no KPIs that show significant deviations indicative of a failure.
* **Reason:** The data suggests that the change did not cause a failure. While there are anomalies detected by the SCWARN algorithm, these anomalies might be due to various factors and require further investigation to determine their significance.
* **Solution:** Not applicable because there's no evidence of a failure requiring a solution.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The KPIs show clear negative changes after the submission, indicating a problem.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  These KPIs show the most significant deviations from normal behavior:
    * **istio_success_rate:** A dramatic drop suggests problems with service communication using Istio.
    * **istio_count:** An increase could mean more Istio requests are being made, possibly due to errors or retries.
    * **net_recv_packet:** An increase might indicate unexpected network traffic.
    * **net_send_packet:** An increase could be a result of the service trying to compensate for issues.
    * **memory_usage:** A decrease might seem positive, but it could indicate resource starvation or unusual behavior.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests a problem with the service's communication, network interaction, and resource management after the change.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Review Changes:** Carefully examine the configuration changes made during the deployment.
    * **Log Analysis:** Analyze system and application logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that correlate with the KPI changes.
    * **Metric Deep Dive:**  Investigate the trends and patterns of the affected KPIs in more detail to pinpoint the exact nature of the deviations.
    * **Rollback or Mitigation:** If the issue is severe, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous state. Otherwise, implement temporary mitigating measures to stabilize the system while a permanent solution is found.

	"reason": "The KPIs 'istio_success_rate' and 'istio_duration' show significant decreases after the change, indicating potential issues with service communication.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  We classify this as "failure" because several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp decrease indicates problems with successful communication between services.
    * `istio_duration`: A decrease in duration could mean requests are being handled faster, but it might also indicate incomplete processing or dropped requests.
    * `memory_usage`: While a decrease might seem positive, it could be a sign of resource starvation or inefficient memory management if accompanied by other performance issues.
    * `net_send_packet`: A decrease suggests potentially less data being sent, which could indicate reduced workload or a blockage in the communication flow.
    * `cpu_usage`: A decrease could mean the system is underutilized, but it might also be a symptom of a bottleneck elsewhere, preventing the CPU from being fully utilized.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes points to potential issues with service communication, resource management, and overall system performance. The decrease in `istio_success_rate` and `istio_duration` strongly suggests problems with the service mesh (Istio) and its ability to handle requests efficiently.
* **Solution:**
    * **Investigate Istio:** Analyze logs, trace requests, and monitor Istio's health and performance to pinpoint the root cause of the communication issues.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Review resource allocation and ensure the system has sufficient memory and CPU capacity to handle the workload.
    * **Network Monitoring:** Check network traffic patterns and identify potential bottlenecks or congestion points.
    * **Alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect anomalies in these KPIs and trigger investigations.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) following the change.  'istio_success_rate' shows a drastically reduced success rate, 'istio_duration' experiences a significant increase in average duration, and 'net_send_packet', 'net_recv_packet', and 'istio_count' exhibit changes in their ranges and trends, indicating potential network or service communication issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'istio_success_rate', 'istio_duration', 'net_send_packet', 'net_recv_packet', and 'istio_count'. This could involve reviewing logs, monitoring network traffic, and checking the configuration of the Istio service mesh. Implement necessary fixes to restore normal service performance and stability."

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests issues with communication or service invocation within the Istio mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: A significant increase in average duration implies slowdowns or bottlenecks in service requests.
    * `net_send_packet`, `net_recv_packet`: Changes in these network metrics point to potential communication problems.
    * `istio_count`: A shift in the count of Istio operations could indicate misconfigurations or unexpected behavior within the mesh.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a failure in the service or a disruption within the Istio mesh.
* **Solution:** A thorough investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. This could involve:
    * Analyzing logs for errors or warnings related to Istio or network communication.
    * Monitoring network traffic to identify bottlenecks or unusual patterns.
    * Reviewing Istio configuration files for potential misconfigurations.
    * Checking the health and status of the underlying infrastructure.
