**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** Set to "failure" because the KPI data shows clear deviations after the change, indicating a problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The five KPIs with the most significant changes are listed. Note that  the prompt asks to exclude "build"-related KPIs, which I assume are not present in your provided data.
* **reason:** A concise explanation is given based on the observed KPI changes. It highlights potential issues like resource contention and increased network load.
* **solution:** A general solution is proposed, focusing on identifying the root cause of the problem through code review and considering resource scaling if needed.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "['cpu_usage', 'memory_usage', 'net_recv_packet', 'istio_count', 'istio_count']",
	"reason": "The metrics show a significant drop in CPU usage and memory usage after the change, which could indicate that the service is not being utilized as expected. Additionally, there's a decrease in network reception packets ('net_recv_packet') and an increase in 'istio_count', suggesting potential issues with communication and load balancing.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "Failure" because the metrics clearly show a negative impact after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The most concerning KPIs are `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `net_recv_packet`, and `istio_count`. The unusual changes in these KPIs point towards potential issues.

* **Reason:** The combination of decreased CPU/Memory usage, reduced network reception, and increased 'istio_count' suggests problems with:
    * **Service Utilization:**  The service might not be actively processing as much data as before.
    * **Network Communication:** There could be issues with network connectivity or routing.
    * **Load Balancing:** The change might have disrupted the load distribution within the service mesh, leading to increased requests on specific instances (reflected in 'istio_count').

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Determining why CPU and memory usage dropped. This could involve analyzing application logs, monitoring resource consumption of specific processes, or identifying inefficient code sections.
    * **Network Troubleshooting:**  Examining network logs for errors or dropped packets related to `net_recv_packet`. 
    * **Service Mesh Review:** Investigating the configuration of the service mesh (`istio_count` increase) and looking for potential bottlenecks or misconfigured routing rules that might be causing increased load on certain instances.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_usage, cpu_usage, memory_usage", 
	"reason": "The analysis of KPI values shows significant deviations after the change.  'istio_usage' dropped sharply, 'cpu_usage' increased considerably, and 'memory_usage' also exhibited a notable upward trend. These changes suggest potential resource contention or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'istio_usage' decrease and address any underlying issues. Optimize resource allocation for 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' to prevent further strain.  Review logs and system metrics for additional clues about the performance changes."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The KPI data indicates a problem, so this is classified as a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We highlight the three most impactful KPIs: 'istio_usage', 'cpu_usage', and 'memory_usage'.
* **reason**:  The reason clearly states the observed changes in the KPIs and suggests potential causes like resource contention or performance degradation. 
* **solution**: The solution provides actionable steps to investigate the issue, optimize resources, and gather more information for troubleshooting.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the provided KPI data shows substantial increases in CPU usage, memory usage, and network activity after the change. This strongly suggests a negative impact.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The list includes the KPIs with the most significant deviations. Note that "build" KPIs are excluded as per your instructions.
* **reason:**  A clear explanation linking the abnormal KPI values to potential issues like performance bottlenecks or resource contention.
* **solution:**  A general recommendation to investigate the code changes, optimize performance, and monitor the system closely.
