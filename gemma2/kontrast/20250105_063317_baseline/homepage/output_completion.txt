	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant drop in `request_success_rate` from an average of -0.0475 before the change to 0.0 after the change. Additionally, `request_count` showed a sudden increase followed by fluctuations. These anomalies suggest that the change negatively impacted the service's performance and stability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to the service homepage to identify the root cause of the `request_success_rate` drop and the fluctuations in `request_count`. Rollback the changes or implement a fix that addresses the identified issues."
}
``` 



Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Metrics Deviation:** The drastic shift from an average `request_success_rate` of -0.0475 to 0.0 indicates a severe problem with the service successfully handling requests. This is a clear indicator of failure.
* **Anomaly Pattern:** The `Single spike` anomaly in `request_count` followed by fluctuations suggests instability and potential resource contention issues introduced by the change.  

These combined factors point towards the change being detrimental to the homepage service. 


Let me know if you have any more questions or would like further clarification!
