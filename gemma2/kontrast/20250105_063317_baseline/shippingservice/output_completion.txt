{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in memory usage, CPU usage, istio duration, network send/receive packets indicate a performance issue or potential system overload following the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the nature of the change and identify its impact on these resources.  Consider: \n* Reviewing application logs for errors or increased load.\n* Profiling the code to pinpoint resource-intensive sections.\n* Scaling infrastructure (e.g., adding more servers) if necessary.\n* Optimizing database queries and application logic to reduce resource consumption."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data shows a clear pattern of abnormal KPI behavior after the change.

* **Memory usage, CPU usage, istio_duration:** These metrics all increased significantly, suggesting the system is under heavier load. 
* **net_send_packet and net_recv_packet:**  Increases in these network metrics further support the idea of increased system activity or potential bottlenecks.

This combination of factors strongly suggests a "failure" scenario where the change negatively impacted system performance.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, net_send_packet, memory_usage, istio_duration, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'memory_usage', 'net_send_packet', and 'net_recv_packet' exhibit increased volatility and wider ranges compared to pre-change values.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The significant deviations in KPIs strongly suggest a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  We list the KPIs with the most dramatic changes, focusing on those that directly impact service performance (duration, network traffic, and memory usage).
* **reason**:  The explanation clearly links the KPI changes to potential issues like resource contention, code bugs, or infrastructure problems.
* **solution**: The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach:

    1. **Identify the root cause:** This involves a combination of reviewing recent changes, analyzing system metrics, and examining logs.
    2. **Rollback (if appropriate):** If the recent change is identified as the culprit, rolling back to a stable state might be the quickest solution.

**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates that the key performance indicators (KPIs)  like `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `istio_duration`, and others, while showing some variation, remain within their expected ranges. There are no dramatic spikes or drops that would suggest a system failure or severe performance degradation. The "anomaly description shapes" further reinforce this by indicating the types of fluctuations observed, which don't point to critical issues.

Therefore, based on the data, the change can be classified as "normal."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Several key metrics exhibit significant deviations after the change.  'istio_duration' shows a much wider range with notably higher values, indicating potential performance issues. 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' also have expanded ranges, suggesting increased network load.  'memory_usage' and 'cpu_usage' while still within expected ranges, show changes that could indicate resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased 'istio_duration'. Analyze logs and system resources to pinpoint bottlenecks related to network communication ('net_send_packet', 'net_recv_packet') and potential memory/CPU pressure ('memory_usage', 'cpu_usage'). Consider optimizing application code, scaling infrastructure, or adjusting resource allocation based on findings."
