{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_duration", 
	"reason": "The metrics cpu_usage, istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, and istio_duration show significant deviations from their pre-change trends. CPU usage decreased while other KPIs experienced increased fluctuations and ranges after the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the recent changes made to the system to identify potential causes for these metric variations. Analyze logs and system performance data to pinpoint specific areas of concern.  Consider rolling back the recent changes if they appear to be the primary cause of the instability." 
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** We classify this as "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These are the KPIs with the most significant changes post-change.
* **reason:**  The reason is based on the observed metric shifts – CPU usage going down while others become more volatile, indicating a possible disruption in system resource utilization or processing.
* **solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes investigation and potential rollback as initial steps to address the issue.

}
``` 


Let me explain the reasoning behind this response:

* **`change_type`: "failure"`** - The data presented shows clear deviations from previous trends in multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This suggests a problem, warranting further investigation.

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**:  I've selected five KPIs showing the most significant changes:
    * `cpu_usage`: High CPU usage can indicate resource contention and potentially slow down the system.
    * `istio_count`: This KPI might relate to service mesh interactions; a sudden change could point to issues with communication or routing within the system.
    * `net_send_packet` & `net_recv_packet`: Changes in network traffic patterns can signal increased load, potential bottlenecks, or even malicious activity.
    * `istio_duration`: Longer durations for service interactions might suggest performance degradation or delays within the system.

* **`reason`**:  The explanation highlights that these KPIs demonstrate a clear departure from their typical behavior, suggesting a problem impacting performance or resource utilization.

* **`solution`**: The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Determining the underlying reason for the anomalies. This could involve examining recent changes in application usage patterns, system configurations, or hardware resources.
    * **Proactive Monitoring:** Implementing closer monitoring of these KPIs and setting up alerts to notify administrators when deviations occur.



Remember that this is a preliminary assessment based on the provided data.  A thorough investigation would require more context, logs, and potentially deeper analysis tools.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The provided data indicates that key metrics experienced negative shifts after the change, suggesting a failure.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  These are the KPIs showing the most significant deviations, potentially indicative of problems. I've selected the ones with the most drastic changes in range, mean, or trend.
* **reason**: This explains the basis for classifying the change as a failure – the metric data points to a problem.

* **solution**:  This offers a general course of action:
    1. **Investigate:** Pinpoint the exact code changes responsible for the metric shifts.
    2. **Rollback (if possible):** If safe, reverting the changes might be the quickest solution. 
    3. **Targeted fixes:** Otherwise, address the issues causing the abnormal metrics directly.

'istio_count', 'net_send_packet', and 'cpu_usage' exhibit notable decreases, while 'net_recv_packet' shows a substantial drop. Additionally, 'istio_duration' experiences fluctuations. These combined changes suggest potential resource constraints, network issues, or application performance problems.",
	"solution": "1. **Monitor System Resources:**  Closely track CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O to identify bottlenecks. 2. **Network Analysis:** Investigate network traffic patterns and latency to pinpoint any congestion or connectivity problems. 3. **Application Performance Review:** Analyze application logs and profiling data to pinpoint performance issues within the codebase. 4. **Scaling Considerations:** Evaluate if additional resources (e.g., CPU, memory) are needed to handle the current load. 5. **Code Optimization:**  Review application code for potential inefficiencies and areas for optimization."
