}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The change is classified as a failure because the provided metrics indicate a clear deviation from expected behavior.  Both 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant shifts, pointing towards a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** While only two KPIs are explicitly mentioned, "request_duration" and "request_count", it's important to note that the analysis should consider other relevant KPIs as well for a comprehensive assessment. 
* **Reason:** The increased 'request_duration' suggests that requests are taking significantly longer to be processed after the change, potentially due to inefficient code execution or resource contention.  The decreased 'request_count' might indicate that fewer requests are being made or successfully handled, which could be related to issues with the service availability or user experience.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on identifying the root cause of these anomalies. This involves a thorough review of the code changes, log analysis for error messages or performance bottlenecks, and possibly stress testing to understand how the system behaves under load after the change.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure:

* **Request Duration Anomaly:** The maximum request duration increased significantly, and the overall trend shifted from downward to upward. This suggests that requests are taking longer to process after the change.
* **Request Count Anomaly:** The minimum and maximum request counts both decreased, indicating fewer requests being handled.  This could be due to issues preventing requests from reaching the service or a decline in user activity. 

The combination of these anomalies points to a problem with the service's functionality or performance after the change.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the provided metrics indicate a clear negative impact on system performance.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    *  `request_duration`: The maximum value has spiked significantly, suggesting that some requests are taking much longer to process.
    * `request_count`: A decrease in both the range and mean indicates fewer requests are being handled after the change. This could be a symptom of the service becoming less responsive or encountering errors. 

* **Reason:** The combination of increased request duration and decreased request count points towards potential performance bottlenecks, resource exhaustion, or bugs introduced by the change.  The `SCWARN` algorithm also flagged an anomaly at a specific time, further supporting this conclusion.

* **Solution:** A focused investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. Reviewing logs around the identified anomaly time will be crucial in understanding what occurred and how to fix it.

}
``` 



Let me break down why I classified this as a failure:

* **Request Duration:** The spike in maximum request duration (from 0 to 11.29) indicates a significant performance degradation. This could be due to slow database queries, inefficient code execution, or resource contention.
* **Request Count:** A decrease in the average and minimum 'request_count' suggests that fewer users are interacting with the service. This could indicate a problem with the service itself, making it less appealing to users, or potential issues with external dependencies preventing successful requests. 

The provided data points strongly suggest the change introduced issues affecting both performance and user engagement.

Let me break down why this classification is appropriate:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:**  The metrics provided ("request_duration" and "request_count") show changes in their ranges before and after the change, but these changes are not drastic enough to be considered failures. There's no indication of sudden spikes, drops, or sustained abnormal trends that would point to a system malfunction.
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The analysis explicitly states that the SCWARN algorithm did not identify any anomalies. 

* **Normal Trend Patterns:** The descriptions of the trend patterns ("whole trend: up" and "whole trend: down") are general observations rather than specific indicators of a failure. These trends could be due to normal fluctuations in system usage or other factors unrelated to the change.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure**: The provided data clearly shows deviations in key metrics post-change, indicating a failure. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs**: 'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary indicators of failure based on the described changes. While other metrics might be affected, these two directly reflect service performance and user experience.
* **Reason:** The significant increase in 'request_duration' implies slowdowns within the currency page service.  The decrease in 'request_count' could indicate issues with load balancing or a potential redirection problem. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Code Review**: Identify recent changes that might be directly impacting these KPIs.
    2. **Log Analysis**:  Look for error messages, exceptions, or unusual patterns in logs that correlate with the timing of the anomalies. 
    3. **Resource Monitoring**: Check CPU and memory usage to see if the system is overloaded during periods of high 'request_duration'.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count", 
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in  'request_duration' and 'request_count' KPIs. After the change, both KPIs show a drastic shift in their range and trend, indicating potential issues with service performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to identify the root cause of these anomalies. Review logs for error messages or other clues that might pinpoint the problem area. Consider rolling back the change if necessary to restore stable service operation."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: 'failure' - The data clearly shows a significant deviation in key metrics after the change, pointing towards a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: "request_duration" and "request_count" are the primary culprits as their ranges and trends have drastically changed after the change.

* **Reason**: The provided data clearly shows that both 'request_duration' (increased maximum value, negative mean) and 'request_count' (significantly reduced range) deviated from their pre-change behavior. This suggests a problem with the service handling requests, potentially leading to slowdowns or failures. 
* **Solution**:  A thorough investigation is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of these anomalies. Logs will be crucial in identifying potential errors or issues related to the change. Rolling back the change might be required as a temporary solution until the root cause is found and fixed.

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count", 
	"reason": "The metrics 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations after the change. 'request_duration' has a drastically increased range (from [0.0,0.0] to [-0.0858,11.8658]) indicating potential performance degradation. 'request_count' also shows a shift in its range and trend.  This suggests that the change likely introduced errors or issues affecting the service.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to 'Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes'. Roll back the recent changes or identify the specific configuration error causing these anomalies. Review logs for detailed error messages and analyze the impact of the white list deletion on the system." 
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided data clearly indicates a failure.  The significant change in 'request_duration' (increased range, indicating slower response times) and the shift in 'request_count' suggest the change negatively impacted the service's performance. 

* **Top Abnormal KPIs:**
    *  **'request_duration':** This KPI's drastic increase indicates that requests are taking significantly longer to process after the change, pointing towards potential performance bottlenecks or errors introduced by the modification.
    * **'request_count':** While the trend changed, the range also shifted. This suggests the change might be affecting how many requests are being processed or handled, potentially due to errors or misconfigurations.

* **Reason:** The "Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" message directly points to a potential cause of the failure.  White list deletions can have unintended consequences by allowing unauthorized access or disrupting expected system behavior.

* **Solution:**
    1. **Rollback:** If possible, immediately roll back the recent changes to restore the service to its previous stable state.
    2. **Investigation:** Thoroughly review the code changes and configuration files related to the white list deletion. Identify the exact error or misconfiguration that caused these issues.
    3. **Error Logging:** Examine system logs for detailed error messages related to the service and the time period when the anomalies occurred. These logs can provide valuable clues about the nature of the problems.
