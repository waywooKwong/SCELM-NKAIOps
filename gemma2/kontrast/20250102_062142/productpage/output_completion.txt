Let me break down why this classification is "normal":

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** The metrics provided show slight changes in 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' but remain within acceptable ranges.
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm, responsible for identifying anomalies, flags no significant issues during the change window. 
* **Absence of Negative Symptoms:** There is no mention of increased error rates, decreased system availability, or any other negative performance indicators.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The metrics indicate a potential failure.  The 'request_success_rate' shows a slight increase after the change, which could suggest successful requests are becoming less frequent. Additionally, 'request_count' demonstrates an upward trend despite the decrease in success rate, hinting at potentially more failed requests.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to IP address configuration and software modifications.  Review logs for errors or exceptions occurring during request processing. Implement thorough testing to identify the root cause of the abnormal behavior and implement a fix." 
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** 'failure' because the metrics show a negative deviation from expected behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** "request_success_rate" and "request_count" are flagged as primary anomalies due to their unusual trends. While other KPIs might be affected, these two directly relate to request handling and success.
* **Reason:** The provided data suggests the change has introduced issues with request processing.  A lower success rate despite an increased request count points to problems in fulfilling requests successfully. This aligns with the initial anomaly description mentioning "Wrong IP Address," "Configuration Errors," and "Defective Software Changes."
* **Solution:** A multi-pronged approach is needed: 

    1. **Code Review:** Examine the changes related to IP address configuration and software updates to pinpoint the exact source of the problem.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize system logs for error messages, exceptions, or unusual patterns that correlate with the time of the change.
    3. **Testing:** Implement rigorous testing to reproduce the observed behavior and identify specific scenarios where requests fail.

	"reason": "The metrics indicate a failure. The 'request_success_rate' decreased after the change and the 'request_count' showed an unexpected upward trend despite the decrease in success rate. This suggests potential issues with the software changes impacting service functionality.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on key metrics like `request_success_rate` and an unexpected increase in `request_count`. This points towards a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** While only two KPIs are explicitly mentioned, it's important to note that other KPIs might be affected as well. The analysis should consider a wider range of metrics for a complete picture.  
* **Reason:** The decrease in `request_success_rate` combined with the unexpected rise in `request_count` strongly suggests that the software changes are causing issues, possibly leading to failed requests and increased attempts. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Rollback:** Immediately reverting to a known working state to minimize disruption.
    * **Code Review:** Identifying the specific code changes responsible for the issue.
    * **Enhanced Monitoring:**  Implementing more comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect similar problems in the future.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Since there are no abnormal KPIs identified, this field remains empty.

* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that all indicator data is within acceptable thresholds and there are no new log patterns indicating issues. This strongly suggests that the change was successful and did not introduce any problems.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The metrics clearly indicate a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' are the primary anomalies as they show a direct correlation with the change.  We focus on these two as they directly relate to the core functionality of the service.

* **Reason:** The decrease in 'request_success_rate' points to problems with the system handling requests correctly. This is further emphasized by the increase in 'request_count', suggesting that more requests are being sent (possibly due to retries caused by failures).

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution outlines a systematic approach:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the specific code changes introduced that could be causing the problem.
    * **Log Review:** Analyze logs for error messages or patterns that might provide clues about the failure mechanism. 
    * **Rollback/Patching:** Depending on severity, consider reverting the problematic changes (rollback) or applying a targeted fix (patch).

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" - The provided metrics clearly indicate a negative impact post-change. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  "request_success_rate", "request_count" - These are the key KPIs that show significant deviation after the change. A decrease in success rate and an increase in request count point towards problems.
* **Reason:** The data shows a clear decline in the success rate of requests and a rise in the total number of requests after the change. This combination strongly suggests that the implemented changes have introduced issues, potentially bugs or performance bottlenecks, causing more requests to fail and overall system strain.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution outlines a systematic approach to addressing the failure:
    1. **Code Review:**  Thoroughly examine the code modifications made during the deployment to pinpoint the exact source of the problems.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that might correlate with the observed changes in KPIs.
    3. **Rollback/Hotfix:** Consider reverting to a previous stable version of the software (rollback) if possible, or implement a temporary fix (hotfix) to mitigate the immediate impact while a permanent solution is developed.

	"change_type": "normal",

**Explanation:**

Based on your provided analysis, the following points are key:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** The metrics like `request_success_rate` and `request_count`  show minor fluctuations within normal ranges. There's no indication of a sudden drop or spike that would point to a failure.
* **Threshold Not Exceeded:** You explicitly state that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal." This aligns with the definition of a normal change.
* **SCWARN Algorithm Findings:** The SCWARN algorithm detecting no faults further supports the classification as normal.

Since there's no evidence of performance degradation or anomalies exceeding thresholds, classifying this change as "normal" is accurate.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": null,
	"reason": "The provided data shows no significant deviations in KPIs after the change.  All indicator data is within expected thresholds.",
	"solution": null
}
``` 


Let me break down why this change is classified as "normal":

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** The metrics like `request_success_rate` and `request_count` show minimal changes, both before and after the change. Their ranges remain similar, indicating no major performance disruptions.
* **Threshold Compliance:**  You explicitly mention that all indicator data is within its defined thresholds, which means no critical alerts were triggered by the monitoring system. 

While the "SCWARN algorithm" identifies anomalies at specific timestamps, these are likely minor fluctuations and don't necessarily indicate a failed change. Further investigation might be needed to understand the nature of these anomalies, but based on the current data, they don't appear to be major causes for concern.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates no significant deviations in KPIs before and after the change. All indicator data remains within acceptable thresholds.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis clearly states that there are no significant KPI deviations or anomalies detected.  Since all metrics fall within expected ranges and no abnormal patterns were observed, classifying this change as "normal" is appropriate.
