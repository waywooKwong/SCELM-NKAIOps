```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'. The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration.  'request_count' shows a wider range and shift in trend, while 'request_success_rate' also shows a wider range and a shift in trend.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects related to handling requests and success rates. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. Pay attention to logs related to request processing and success handling. \n3.  **Investigate the 'Deleting White List by Mistake' incident:** Given the SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies at specific timestamps (21:14:00 and 21:16:00), it's crucial to investigate if there was any related activity during those times, such as a potential mistake in deleting the white list. \n4. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic to see if there are any bottlenecks or resource limitations that could be contributing to the anomalies."
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change. This indicates a problem.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "request_count", "request_success_rate". These are the primary KPIs affected by the change.
* **Reason:** The drastic shift in data ranges and trends for these KPIs strongly suggests a malfunction or misconfiguration introduced by the change.

* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on:
    * Identifying the root cause through code review, log analysis, and investigation of potential incidents like "Deleting White List by Mistake".
    * Monitoring system resources to rule out performance issues as a contributing factor.

**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that while anomalies were detected, the provided data doesn't clearly demonstrate a "failure" scenario. Here's why:

* **Limited KPI Data:** The output only provides information about two KPIs: 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'. A comprehensive assessment would require analyzing a wider range of KPIs relevant to system performance and functionality.
* **Unclear Anomaly Impact:** The SCWARN algorithm flags anomalies, but the provided text doesn't specify how these anomalies affect overall system behavior or user experience. Further details about the nature and severity of these anomalies are needed.
* **Data Range Comparison:**  The data ranges for 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' show changes after the change, but these changes don't necessarily point to a significant degradation in performance. 

**Next Steps:**

To make a more definitive conclusion, it's crucial to:

1. **Collect More KPI Data:** Analyze a broader set of KPIs that encompass various aspects of system performance (e.g., latency, error rates, throughput, resource utilization).
2. **Investigate Anomaly Details:**  Understand the specific nature and impact of the anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm. Determine if they are transient or persistent, and whether they correlate with any noticeable issues reported by users or observed in system logs. 3. **Compare to Historical Baselines:** Compare post-change KPI values to historical baselines to identify significant deviations from normal behavior patterns.
4. **Review Change Logs:** Examine the details of the implemented changes to identify potential areas that might have introduced unintended consequences.
