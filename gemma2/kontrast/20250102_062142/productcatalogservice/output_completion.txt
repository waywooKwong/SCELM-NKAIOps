**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates that all KPI values are within acceptable thresholds. There's no mention of any KPIs exceeding limits or exhibiting abnormal behavior.  Therefore:

* **`change_type`**:  is set to "normal" 
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**: is left as `null` since there are no abnormal KPIs.
* **`reason`**:  Clearly states that the data falls within normal operating parameters.
* **`solution`**:  Is not provided because no issues were identified.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure** - The significant drops in memory usage, CPU usage, and Istio metrics coupled with a restricted range in diskIO strongly suggest a negative impact from the change.  

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: These are the most concerning KPIs showing the largest deviations after the change.

* **solution**:  This outlines steps to investigate and address the potential failure.
