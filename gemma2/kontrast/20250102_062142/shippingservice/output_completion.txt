    * `istio_duration`: A sharp increase suggests issues with service communication or routing within Istio.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`:  Significant changes here point to increased network load, which could be caused by application behavior or underlying infrastructure bottlenecks.
    * `memory_usage`:  A notable increase might indicate memory leaks or inefficient memory management within the application.

* **Reason:** This provides a concise explanation linking the abnormal KPIs to potential problems.

* **Solution:** Offers general guidance on troubleshooting and addressing the identified issues. Specific steps would depend on further investigation and understanding of the system's architecture.
