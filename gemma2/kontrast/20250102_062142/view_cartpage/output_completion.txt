This may involve techniques like reducing unnecessary data access, improving algorithm efficiency, or utilizing caching mechanisms.\n4. **Debugging and Testing:** Implement rigorous debugging and testing strategies to catch and resolve resource-related issues early in the development cycle."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided information clearly points towards a "failure" change.  Here's why:

* **Specific Anomaly:** The key indicator is "Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes". This directly suggests that the software changes introduced defects leading to competition for resources, which is a serious issue.
* **Impact:** Resource contention can cause performance degradation, slowdowns, application crashes, and other system instability.


The suggested solution focuses on:

1. **Identifying the root cause** through code review and performance analysis.
2. **Optimizing resource usage** within the affected code.
3. **Implementing robust testing** to prevent similar issues in future changes.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**:  We classify this change as "normal" because the provided data does not reveal any significant performance degradation or abnormal behavior after the change.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs**: Since there are no identified anomalies exceeding thresholds, we mark this field as "N/A".

* **Reason**: The analysis highlights that despite a potential human error ("Deleting White List by Mistake"), the subsequent KPI monitoring shows  stable performance trends for metrics like `request_count` and `request_success_rate`. This indicates the system has likely recovered or compensated for the initial issue. 

* **Solution**: Given the absence of any major problems indicated by the data, a specific solution is not required at this time. Continued monitoring of KPIs is recommended to ensure sustained stability.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: normal:** The metrics presented do not show any significant drops in performance or unusual spikes after the change.  While there were anomalies detected, they are described as transient and didn't cause persistent issues. 

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  This section is left blank because no KPIs were identified as primary contributors to a failure.

* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that the data supports a "normal" change classification. There's no evidence of widespread performance degradation or errors after the implementation.

* **Solution**: Since the change appears to be normal, there is no immediate solution required.
