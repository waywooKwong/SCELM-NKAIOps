}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change, indicating a disruption in service performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests problems with service communication.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration implies delays in service requests.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Decreased network reception suggests reduced traffic or connectivity issues.
    * `net_send_packet`: Decreased network sending indicates potential service unavailability or issues.
    * `istio_count`: While trending upwards, the rate of increase has decreased, possibly indicating a bottleneck.
* **Reason:** The significant deviations in these KPIs strongly suggest that the change introduced issues into the system, impacting service performance and reliability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions focus on investigating the root causes of the identified issues and implementing corrective measures to restore normal service operation.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators.  'istio_success_rate'  dropped sharply, 'istio_duration'  showed a large increase, and 'net_send_packet', 'net_recv_packet', and 'istio_count'  exhibited unusual fluctuations. These indicate potential issues with service communication and resource utilization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'istio_success_rate' and 'istio_duration'.  Review logs and system configurations related to Istio and the frontend service. Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) closely and consider scaling resources if necessary.  Analyze the network traffic patterns associated with 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' to identify potential bottlenecks or anomalies."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant drops in 'istio_success_rate', the large increase in 'istio_duration', and the unusual fluctuations in other KPIs strongly suggest a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the KPIs that show the most drastic changes after the change, indicating the areas most affected.
* **Reason:** The provided analysis clearly explains the connection between the abnormal KPI values and potential issues with service communication, resource utilization, and network traffic.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on targeted troubleshooting steps:
    * **Istio Analysis:** Investigate the Istio configuration and logs to pinpoint the cause of the 'istio_success_rate' drop and the increased 'istio_duration'.
    * **Resource Monitoring:**  Closely monitor CPU and memory usage to identify potential resource constraints.
    * **Network Traffic Analysis:** Examine the network traffic patterns related to 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' to look for bottlenecks or unusual behavior.
