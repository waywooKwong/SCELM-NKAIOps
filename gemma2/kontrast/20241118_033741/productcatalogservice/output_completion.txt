``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no signs of a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no abnormal KPIs identified as critical failures.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights that the KPIs remain stable and within expected ranges. While the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies, these are not classified as failures based on the context. 
* **solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified requiring a solution.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from historical norms, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** 
    * `memory_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `istio_duration`:  Showed a large increase, suggesting increased latency in service calls.
    * `istio_count`: Increased, indicating more frequent service calls.
    * `net_recv_packet`:  While less dramatic, the upward trend suggests increased network traffic.
* **Reason:** The combination of increased resource usage and network traffic points to a potential issue with the change. It's possible that the change introduced new functionality or altered existing processes that are now demanding more resources.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the increased resource consumption. This involves a combination of code review, performance monitoring, and potential optimization strategies.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant changes in KPIs like memory usage, CPU usage, and network packet reception point to a failure.  
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_count, istio_duration, net_recv_packet" as the primary contributors to the failure.
* **Reason:** The changes in these KPIs suggest a disruption in system performance. Increased memory usage and fluctuating network traffic can indicate resource contention or inefficient code execution. The increased 'istio_count' and 'istio_duration' suggest problems with the service mesh, potentially causing communication delays.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * Identifying the cause of increased memory usage and network fluctuations.
    * Investigating the Istio configuration for potential bottlenecks or misconfigurations.
    * Optimizing resource allocation and system configurations to improve performance.

    * `memory_usage`: Increased, indicating potential resource contention.
    * `cpu_usage`: Decreased, suggesting the system might be underutilized or facing issues.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, pointing to potential delays in service communication.
    * `diskio`: Drastically decreased, suggesting a problem with storage access.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Decreased, indicating potential network connectivity problems. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these changes suggests a systemic issue introduced by the change.
