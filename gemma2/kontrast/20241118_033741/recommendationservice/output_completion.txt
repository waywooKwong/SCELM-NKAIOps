**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the provided data doesn't point to a clear failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The five most significantly affected KPIs are listed.  Note that KPIs with "build" in their name are excluded as requested.
* **reason:** The explanation focuses on the observed anomalies being within acceptable ranges and potentially due to normal fluctuations.
* **solution:** Since it's not a failure, the solution is to continue monitoring the KPIs.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The five KPIs listed are those that experienced the most significant and concerning deviations.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the drop in 'istio_success_rate',  the stagnation of 'diskio', the increase in 'cpu_usage', the decrease in 'istio_count', and the reduction in 'net_send_packet'. These are all indicators of a potential problem with the service's performance and stability.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on understanding the root cause of the issues.  Rolling back the changes if possible is a first step. Continuous monitoring and further investigation are crucial to identify and address the underlying problems.
