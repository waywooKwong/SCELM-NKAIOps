{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  net_send_packet and diskio show increased volatility, memory_usage spiked, and istio_count and istio_duration exhibit unusual fluctuations. These indicate potential resource contention or application performance issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the application code and infrastructure configuration for potential bottlenecks or resource exhaustion. Analyze logs and system events around the anomaly timestamps for further clues. Consider scaling resources or optimizing application performance to mitigate the observed issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The chosen KPIs reflect the most significant changes:
    * **net_send_packet:** Increased volatility suggests network communication issues.
    * **diskio:**  A shift to higher activity could indicate disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * **memory_usage:**  The spike suggests potential memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
    * **istio_count:**  Unusual fluctuations in Istio calls might point to misconfigurations or increased load on the service mesh.
    * **istio_duration:**  Longer durations for Istio calls could signal performance problems within the service mesh.
* **Reason:** The combined changes in these KPIs strongly suggest that the change introduced problems affecting network communication, resource utilization, and potentially the service mesh.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Debugging:** Analyzing the application code and infrastructure to pinpoint the source of the problems.
    * **Resource Management:** Scaling resources (CPU, memory, network) to handle the increased load.
    * **Performance Optimization:** Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks within the application and the service mesh.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPI metrics remain within historical norms and show no significant deviations after the change.  There are no indications of system performance degradation or failures.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" 
   The analysis states that KPIs remain within expected ranges and there's no evidence of system disruption.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A"
   Since the change type is "normal," there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.

* **Reason:** The metrics and symptoms clearly show that the change did not negatively impact system performance. KPIs like `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_success_rate`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`  either maintained their normal ranges or showed slight variations that are not indicative of a failure.

* **Solution:** "N/A"  
   As there's no failure, no solution is required.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" - The significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) point towards a failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The listed KPIs show the most drastic changes after the deployment.
* **Reason:** The metrics clearly indicate a problem. The  increases and decreases in these KPIs suggest that the change negatively impacted system performance and stability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    * **Code Review:** Examine the changes made to pinpoint the source of the problem.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Logs can provide valuable clues about errors or unusual events occurring after the change.
    * **Configuration Check:**  Ensure that system configurations haven't been inadvertently altered.
    * **Rollback:** If the issue is severe, rolling back the change might be the quickest way to restore stability.
    * **Fix Implementation:**  Once the root cause is identified, develop and implement a fix to address the problem permanently.
