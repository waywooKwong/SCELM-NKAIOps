**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" - The drastic drop in `istio_success_rate` to 0% and the significant increases in other KPIs point towards a major issue. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs demonstrate a clear pattern of performance degradation:
    * `istio_success_rate`:  A complete failure rate indicates a serious problem with communication or service requests.
    * `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`: Increased values suggest the system is under heavy load, potentially due to the change.
    * `net_send_packet`:  A large increase in network traffic could indicate a faulty process or misconfigured service.
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced a bug or misconfiguration that is causing the system to malfunction.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Identify the Root Cause:**  Analyze the implemented changes to pinpoint the exact source of the problem.
    * **Review Logs and Configurations:**  Examine system logs for error messages and review configurations for any inconsistencies introduced by the change.
    * **Rollback or Corrective Measures:** If possible, revert the change to restore the system to a stable state. If a rollback is not feasible, implement specific fixes to address the identified issues.
