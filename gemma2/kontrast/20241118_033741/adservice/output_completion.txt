**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative impacts after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list prioritizes KPIs with the most significant changes:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased significantly, likely indicating slow response times.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased drastically, suggesting a high failure rate for requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased, indicating the system is struggling to handle the workload.
    * `memory_usage`:  Increased, suggesting potential memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Decreased, possibly due to network issues or reduced traffic.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to a failure.  The system is experiencing performance issues, resource contention, and potential network problems.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting:
    * **Identify the root cause:** Analyze logs and system behavior to pinpoint the source of the issues.
    * **Revert the change:** If the change is clearly causing the problems, reverting it might be the quickest solution.

'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show substantial increases and decreases respectively, indicating potential issues with service performance. 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' also show increased ranges, suggesting resource contention. 'net_send_packet' shows a slight increase in range, potentially indicating increased network traffic.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased 'istio_duration' and decreased 'istio_success_rate'. Optimize resource allocation to address the elevated 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage'. Monitor network traffic and identify potential bottlenecks affecting 'net_send_packet'. Review the change implementation for any potential errors or misconfigurations."

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their pre-change behavior, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** 
    * `istio_duration`: Increased range suggests latency issues.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased range indicates a higher failure rate for requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased range points to potential resource contention.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased range also suggests resource strain.
    * `net_send_packet`:  Slight increase in range might indicate increased network load.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests that the change introduced problems with service performance, resource utilization, and potentially network traffic.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * Identifying the source of latency and request failures.
    * Optimizing resource allocation to prevent overloading.
    * Monitoring network traffic for bottlenecks.
    * Reviewing the change implementation for potential errors.
