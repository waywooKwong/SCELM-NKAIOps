}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies and several KPIs show significant deviations.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  We focus on the KPIs that directly relate to system performance and resource usage:
    * `memory_usage`: Decreased after the change, which could indicate inefficient memory management or a change in application behavior.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased with a wider range, suggesting the system is under heavier load.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased range implies increased latency in communication within the service mesh, potentially affecting application performance. 
* **Reason:** The combination of SCWARN alerts and the KPI changes strongly suggests a failure. The specific changes in memory and CPU usage, along with increased istio_duration, point to potential resource contention and performance degradation.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on identifying the source of the increased CPU usage and resource contention through code review, log analysis, and performance monitoring. It suggests optimization, resource allocation adjustments, or infrastructure scaling as potential remedies.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The presence of anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm and the significant deviations in KPIs like `net_recv_packet`, `cpu_usage`, `diskio`, and `istio_count` strongly suggest a **failure**.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights the following KPIs as primary contributors to the failure:
    * `net_recv_packet`: Decreased packet reception indicates potential network connectivity issues or service disruptions.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased CPU usage suggests a performance bottleneck or resource contention.
    * `diskio`: Elevated disk activity could point to excessive data writes or slow disk performance.
    * `istio_count`:  Higher Istio traffic suggests increased workload or potential misconfigurations within the service mesh.
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these abnormal KPIs points to a failure scenario where the change introduced performance degradation, resource contention, and potential network issues.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identifying the specific reasons behind the increased CPU usage, disk I/O, and network issues.
    * **Resource Optimization:**  Adjusting resource allocation to ensure sufficient CPU, memory, and disk capacity to handle the workload.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The presence of anomalies detected by the SCWARN algorithm and the significant deviations in KPIs strongly suggest a **failure**.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list prioritizes KPIs showing the most drastic changes:
    * `memory_usage`: Increased usage indicates the system might be consuming more resources.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased usage suggests the system is working harder, potentially due to inefficient code or increased load.
    * `istio_duration`: Changes in Istio duration could point to issues with service mesh communication.
    * `diskio`: Reduced disk I/O could indicate a bottleneck or inefficient data access patterns.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Changes in network reception metrics might suggest network connectivity or configuration problems.
* **Reason:** The combination of SCWARN alerts and KPI changes paints a clear picture of a system experiencing performance issues after the change. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions are a systematic approach to troubleshooting and resolving the failure:
    1. **Code Review:** Identify the root cause within the deployed code.
    2. **Resource Monitoring:**  Continuously track resource usage to pinpoint bottlenecks.
    3. **Network Analysis:** Investigate network traffic patterns for potential issues.
    4. **Istio Configuration:**  Ensure the service mesh configuration is correct after the change.
    5. **Rollback:**  A last resort if the issue is severe and requires immediate resolution.
