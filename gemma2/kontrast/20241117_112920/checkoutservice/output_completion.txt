{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, istio_count, cpu_usage, diskio",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant performance degradation as evidenced by the following KPIs: istio_success_rate dropped sharply, net_send_packet decreased, istio_count and cpu_usage showed significant declines, and diskio became stagnant. These indicate issues with service communication, resource utilization, and potentially data processing.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation. This may involve reviewing the change implementation, checking system logs for errors, and analyzing resource utilization patterns. Consider rolling back the change if it's causing significant disruption. Optimize resource allocation and investigate potential bottlenecks in the system."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant negative changes post-change, indicating a system performance issue.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the KPIs that most directly reflect the performance degradation. 
* **Reason:**  The provided KPI data clearly shows a downward trend in crucial metrics like `istio_success_rate` (indicating communication failures), `net_send_packet` (network throughput), `cpu_usage` (resource utilization), and `diskio` (data access). This suggests a systemic problem.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting and mitigation:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the specific cause of the performance issues.
    * **Rollback:** If the change is recent and causing severe problems, consider reverting it.
    * **Resource Optimization:**  Ensure the system has adequate resources (CPU, memory, network) to handle the workload.
    * **Bottleneck Identification:**  Find and address any points in the system where performance is being significantly slowed down.

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, net_send_packet, istio_success_rate, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "The system exhibits a significant shift in performance metrics.  'istio_duration' shows a sustained decrease, indicating potential latency issues. 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' demonstrate fluctuations, suggesting network instability. The drastic increase in 'istio_success_rate' is unusual and might point to inaccurate data or a misconfiguration.  These combined anomalies strongly suggest a service failure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate network infrastructure:** Analyze network logs and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks or outages affecting 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet'. 2. **Review 'istio_duration' trends:** Examine application code and dependencies to pinpoint the source of latency increases in 'istio_duration'. Optimize code for efficiency and consider caching strategies. 3. **Verify 'istio_success_rate' data:**  Ensure the metric is accurately capturing success rates. Investigate potential data corruption or misconfigurations. 4. **Monitor system logs:**  Scrutinize application and system logs for error messages or warnings that might shed light on the root cause of the anomalies. 5. **Roll back recent changes:** If a recent code deployment or configuration update coincided with the performance degradation, consider rolling back to a stable state for further investigation."
