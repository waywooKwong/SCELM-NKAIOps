{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_count, net_send_packet, diskio, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) following the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped sharply, 'istio_count' and 'net_send_packet' showed large increases, and 'diskio' and 'cpu_usage' experienced unexpected upward trends. This suggests the change negatively impacted system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes implemented during this period. Focus on areas related to network communication, resource utilization, and the 'istio' component.  Review logs and system events for error messages or performance bottlenecks. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing mitigations to address the observed issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative impact after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs demonstrate the most significant deviations from historical norms:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop indicates problems with communication or processing within the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_count`: A large increase suggests excessive requests or errors within the Istio system.
    * `net_send_packet`: A significant increase points to potential network congestion or increased data transfer.
    * `diskio`: An unexpected rise might indicate disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased CPU usage suggests the system is struggling to handle the workload.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs strongly suggests the change introduced issues that are negatively affecting system performance, stability, and resource utilization.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to identify and address the root cause:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the recent changes for potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs for error messages, warnings, or performance-related insights.
    * **System Monitoring:** Continuously monitor KPIs and system resources to identify patterns and potential issues.
    * **Rollback/Mitigation:** Consider rolling back the change if possible or implementing temporary mitigations to reduce the impact.
