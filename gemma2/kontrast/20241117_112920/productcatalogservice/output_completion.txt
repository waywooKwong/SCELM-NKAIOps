}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The significant drops in memory usage and the spikes in CPU usage, istio_duration, and istio_count strongly indicate a failure. These changes suggest the system is struggling to handle the workload.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The most impactful KPIs are `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `istio_duration`, and `istio_count`.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to a resource contention issue. The system may be running out of memory, leading to increased CPU usage as it tries to compensate. The spikes in `istio_duration` and `istio_count` suggest problems with service communication or routing, likely exacerbated by the overall system strain.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the resource issues and addressing them. This could involve:
    * **Resource Scaling:** Increasing the allocated resources (CPU, memory) to the service.
    * **Code Optimization:** Identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks within the application code.
    * **Load Balancing:** Ensuring traffic is distributed efficiently across multiple instances of the service.
    * **Monitoring and Logging:** Implementing robust monitoring and logging to track system performance and identify issues early on.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs represent a combination of resource utilization (memory, CPU), network activity (net_recv_packet), and potential system bottlenecks (diskio).
* **Reason:** The provided data indicates a shift in system behavior. Increased memory usage could be a sign of memory leaks or inefficient resource management. The reduced CPU usage range might indicate processes are waiting or being starved for resources. The near-zero diskio suggests potential issues with data access or processing. The decrease in net_recv_packet points to a possible network problem or reduced incoming traffic.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_duration, memory_usage, diskio, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs indicate a failure. CPU usage decreased, while memory usage, diskio, and network metrics (net_send_packet) also show abnormal changes. Istio duration increased, suggesting potential latency issues. These anomalies point to a system malfunction.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant changes in CPU usage, memory usage, diskio, and network metrics, coupled with the increased istio duration, strongly suggest a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **cpu_usage:** Decreased CPU usage can indicate a problem with resource allocation or a process not utilizing available resources.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased istio duration suggests latency issues in service communication, which can impact overall system performance.
    * **memory_usage:**  Abnormal changes in memory usage can lead to performance degradation and potential system crashes.
    * **diskio:**  Abnormal changes in diskio can indicate problems with storage access or I/O operations.
    * **net_send_packet:** Changes in network metrics can point to issues with network connectivity or bandwidth.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs indicates a system malfunction. The decreased CPU usage coupled with increased memory and network usage, along with the latency issues highlighted by the istio duration, suggests a misconfiguration or a bug introduced by the change.

* **Solution:**
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Investigate the specific changes made and identify the root cause of the abnormal KPI behavior.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage closely to identify bottlenecks and ensure proper allocation.
    * **Network Diagnostics:**  Perform network diagnostics to rule out connectivity issues or bandwidth limitations.
    * **Rollback:** Consider rolling back the change if the root cause is identified as a faulty implementation.
    * **Corrective Measures:** Implement corrective measures to address the identified issues and restore system stability.
