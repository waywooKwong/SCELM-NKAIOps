These KPIs indicate a potential issue with the service's ability to handle requests effectively. The 'request_count' experienced a drastic increase in its range and shifted from an upward trend to a mixed trend, while 'request_success_rate' showed a decrease in its range and a downward trend. This suggests a possible bug or configuration error introduced by the change.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift, focusing on areas related to request handling and success rate calculations. \n2. **Analyze logs:** Investigate system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI changes. \n3. **Rollback the change:** If possible, temporarily revert the recent changes to restore the previous state and observe if the KPIs return to normal. \n4. **Monitor KPIs closely:** Continue to track the performance of 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' to identify any further deviations or patterns. \n5. **Test thoroughly:** Conduct rigorous testing to identify the root cause of the issue and ensure the fix resolves the problem."
