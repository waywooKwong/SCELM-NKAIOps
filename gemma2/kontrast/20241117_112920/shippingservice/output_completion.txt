**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear downward trend in performance and stability.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The listed KPIs are the most affected by the change, indicating a widespread impact on the service.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a deterioration in key performance indicators after the change. This suggests the change introduced bugs or misconfigurations that are negatively impacting the service.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:**  Examine the code changes made during the period of the change to pinpoint potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Resource Monitoring:**  Continue to monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify bottlenecks or excessive consumption.
    * **Istio Configuration:**  Review the Istio service mesh configuration to ensure it is correctly set up and not causing routing or communication issues.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the changes to a known working state while investigating the root cause.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant drops in 'istio_success_rate' and the abnormal increases/decreases in other KPIs clearly point to a negative impact on the service's performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen because they represent core aspects of the service's operation:
    * **'istio_success_rate':**  A drastic drop suggests major issues with service requests being successfully completed.
    * **'diskio', 'memory_usage':** Increased resource consumption could indicate a memory leak, inefficient code, or a surge in requests the system can't handle.
    * **'istio_duration':** Longer request processing times imply problems with service responsiveness.
    * **'net_recv_packet':**  Abnormal changes in network reception could signal issues with data transfer or network connectivity.
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced bugs or inefficiencies that are negatively affecting the 'shippingservice'.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific code changes responsible for the issues.
    * **Log and Monitoring Review:** Examining logs and system metrics around the time of the change for more detailed insights.
    * **Rollback:** As a temporary measure, rolling back the changes if the problem is severe and urgent.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs clearly indicate a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  These KPIs are chosen because they show the most drastic changes and point to core issues:
    * `istio_success_rate`:  A drop to 0% means the service is failing to handle requests.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency suggests problems with service invocation.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`:  Large increases indicate network congestion or errors.
    * `memory_usage`:  Higher memory usage could be a sign of inefficient code or resource contention. 
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a pattern of degradation after the change. The specific KPIs affected point to problems in network communication, service reliability, and resource management.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Code Review:**  Analyzing the changes to pinpoint the source of the problems.

```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "All KPI metrics remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations indicating disruptions or performance degradation. The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, but these are not indicative of a failure as they fall within acceptable thresholds.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


Let me know if you have any other change analysis scenarios you'd like me to evaluate!

root_cause_from_redis: set()
Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "None",
	"reason": "All KPI values remain within historical norms and show no significant deviations after the change. There are no indications of system degradation or performance issues.",
	"solution": "None required."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates that the KPIs (istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, cpu_usage, net_send_packet, istio_duration, net_recv_packet)  show changes in their ranges and trends after the change. However, none of these changes exceed established thresholds or indicate a significant negative impact on system performance. 

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, the change is classified as "normal."

	"reason": "The provided data indicates that while there are anomalies detected, the KPIs remain within historical norms and show no significant deviations. The overall trend analysis also suggests no major disruptions or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
