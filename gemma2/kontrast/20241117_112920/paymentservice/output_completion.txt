**Explanation of the Classification:**

* **Failure Change:** The KPIs 'net_send_packet', 'diskio', 'memory_usage', 'istio_count', and 'istio_duration' all show significant changes in their ranges and trends after the change. This indicates a potential disruption in system performance.

* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm's identification of anomalies at specific timestamps further strengthens the classification as a failure. These anomalies suggest unexpected behavior patterns that deviate from the expected norm.

* **Reason:** The combination of KPI deviations and anomaly detection points to a problem introduced by the change.
