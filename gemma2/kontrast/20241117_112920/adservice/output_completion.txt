**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The selected KPIs demonstrate the most drastic changes, pointing to core issues:
    * **istio_duration:**  A large increase in duration suggests requests are taking much longer to process.
    * **istio_success_rate:** A decrease in success rate indicates failures in handling requests.
    * **memory_usage:** Increased memory usage could be a sign of memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * **net_recv_packet:** A wider range in received packets might indicate network instability or issues with data transmission.
    * **istio_count:**  An increase in istio_count could point to more requests being processed, potentially overloading the system. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests a failure. The system is struggling to handle requests efficiently, resulting in longer processing times, increased errors, and potential resource constraints.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting and optimization:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Determine the exact cause of the issues by examining logs, system configurations, and code.
    * **Resource Scaling:** If resource constraints are identified, consider increasing server capacity or optimizing resource allocation.

**Explanation:**

The analysis classifies the change as a **failure** based on the following:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The KPIs 'istio_duration', 'istio_success_rate', 'memory_usage', 'cpu_usage', and 'net_recv_packet' all show substantial changes from their pre-change behavior. These changes point to a negative impact on system performance and stability.

* **Negative Impact Indicators:** 
    *  Decreases in 'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' suggest problems with service communication and request handling.
    * Increases in 'memory_usage' and 'cpu_usage' indicate potential resource exhaustion.
    * The decrease in 'net_recv_packet' might signal reduced network activity or connectivity issues.

* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies, further supporting the classification of the change as a failure.
