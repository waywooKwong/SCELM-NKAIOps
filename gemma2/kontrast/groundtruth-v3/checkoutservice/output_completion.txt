{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change indicate a failure.  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, 'cpu_usage' and 'istio_count' showed abnormal decreases, while 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' experienced unexpected increases. This suggests potential issues with communication, resource utilization, and network performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the 'istio_success_rate' drop:** Analyze logs and metrics related to Istio for errors, misconfigurations, or resource constraints. 2. **Review CPU usage and 'istio_count':** Check for resource bottlenecks, inefficient code, or unexpected load on the service. 3. **Analyze network traffic:** Examine 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' trends for anomalies. Identify potential network congestion or faulty configurations. 4. **Monitor and debug:** Continuously monitor KPIs and logs to pinpoint the root cause of the issues and implement necessary fixes."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests problems with service mesh communication.
    * `cpu_usage`: A decrease could indicate reduced workload or a potential issue with resource allocation.
    * `istio_count`: A decrease might point to fewer requests being processed or issues with Istio routing.
    * `net_send_packet`: An increase could signify excessive data transmission or network issues.
    * `net_recv_packet`: An increase could indicate a surge in incoming data or network problems.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a failure where the change negatively impacted the service's performance, communication, and resource utilization.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on investigating each abnormal KPI to identify the root cause and implement appropriate fixes. This includes examining logs, analyzing resource usage, and troubleshooting network connectivity.
