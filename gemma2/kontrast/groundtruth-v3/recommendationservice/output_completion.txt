	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) post-change.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  We prioritize the KPIs with the most significant changes:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop suggests problems with service communication or request handling.
    * `diskio`:  A decrease could indicate less I/O activity, which might be unexpected or a sign of a bottleneck.
    * `cpu_usage`: A decrease might seem positive, but a sudden drop could point to issues with resource allocation or processes not functioning as expected.
    * `istio_count`: A shift in the number of Istio requests could signal changes in traffic patterns or service interactions. 
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the substantial negative changes in these KPIs, strongly suggesting the change introduced problems.
* **Solution:**  The suggested steps are common for troubleshooting software failures:
    * **Investigate the changes:** Understand precisely what was altered and how it might affect the KPIs.
    * **Analyze logs and monitoring:** Look for error messages, unusual patterns, or resource usage spikes that correlate with the change.
    * **Revert or correct:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous state. If that's not feasible, implement fixes based on the investigation findings.
