Let me explain:

* **change_type:**  Since the provided information states that none of the KPI values exceeded their thresholds, this indicates a normal operation.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Because there are no abnormal KPIs exceeding thresholds, this field remains empty.

* **reason:**  The reason for classifying this as "normal" is directly stated in your input: all indicator data falls within acceptable limits.

* **solution:** A solution is not required when the system is operating normally.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The drastic changes in several key KPIs, especially the significant drop in `istio_success_rate`, point towards a negative impact from the change.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We list the most concerning KPIs that show anomalous behavior after the change.  We exclude "build" related metrics as they are not directly relevant to service performance.
* **reason:** The provided analysis explains *why* these KPIs suggest a failure. It highlights the potential causes and their implications.
* **solution:** This section offers actionable steps to address the identified problems.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**:  The significant drops in 'istio_success_rate' and fluctuations in network-related KPIs strongly suggest a failure or negative impact.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These are the KPIs that show the most drastic changes, indicating core system problems.

* **solution:**  The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach:
    * **Identify the root cause:**  Analyze recent code changes.
    * **Review logs and monitoring data:** Look for error messages or unusual activity patterns.
    * **Consider rollback:** If possible, revert to a working state to isolate the problem.
    * **Testing:** Thoroughly test any fixes before implementing them.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:**  The data clearly indicates a negative impact after the change. The metrics show significant deviations from their previous trends, suggesting a problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  We selected the KPIs with the most drastic changes:
    * `diskio`:  A large increase in disk I/O could indicate inefficient file access or database queries.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A significant drop means that API calls are failing more often, pointing to potential issues with service connectivity or request handling.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`: These changes together suggest network communication problems, either due to increased load or faulty configurations.
    * `istio_duration`: A consistent increase indicates that API calls are taking longer to complete, possibly due to resource contention or slow backend processing.

* **reason:** The explanation clearly connects the abnormal metric changes to potential issues with performance, stability, and service functionality. 

* **solution:**  The solution provides actionable steps:
    * **Root cause analysis:** Identify the exact change that introduced these problems.
    * **Log review:** Look for error messages or warnings related to the affected metrics.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous stable state.
    * **Mitigations:**  Implement temporary fixes to address the most critical issues while investigating further.

The anomalous behaviour of 'diskio' might point to storage issues, and the unexpected trend in 'istio_duration' could imply performance bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the anomalies by examining logs, monitoring system resources, and reviewing recent changes. Consider deploying performance optimizations, troubleshooting network connectivity, and checking for disk space constraints. Additionally, analyze the impact of these deviations on overall system functionality and user experience."

{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_duration, diskio",
	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped dramatically, while 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' experienced large swings in values. 'istio_duration' increased, and 'diskio'  became consistently 0. These changes suggest a potential disruption in network communication and/or a misconfiguration related to the Istio service mesh.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the logs for the affected services:** Look for error messages or unusual events coinciding with the change. 2. **Review Istio configuration files:** Ensure there are no incorrect settings that could be causing the issues. 3. **Monitor network traffic:** Analyze network bandwidth usage and packet loss to identify potential bottlenecks or connectivity problems. 4. **Rollback the recent changes:** If possible, revert the change to a known working state to isolate the issue. 5. **Consult Istio documentation and community forums:** Seek guidance from experts on troubleshooting similar issues."
