	"reason": "All indicator data is within the expected threshold and no significant deviations in KPIs were observed after the change. ",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No KPI Exceeding Thresholds:**  The provided data states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal." This directly indicates that the change did not cause any metric to go outside acceptable bounds.
* **Absence of Anomaly Flags:** The report mentions a total of zero anomalous KPIs and anomaly description shapes. If there were anomalies, they would have been listed here. 

Since there's no evidence of performance degradation or unusual behavior based on the metrics, the change can be classified as "normal."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs). 'request_count' showed a wider range and shifted upwards while 'request_success_rate' exhibited a downward trend and narrower range after the change. This indicates potential issues with service performance and user experience.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies. Review logs for any error messages or unusual patterns around the timestamps when the anomalies occurred.  Consider rolling back the change if the impact is severe."
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

The analysis highlights a "failure" classification due to the following:

* **KPI Deviations:** Both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` show significant changes after the deployment, indicating a negative impact on service performance. 
* **Abnormal Trends:**  While `request_count` increased in magnitude, `request_success_rate` decreased, suggesting potential issues with request handling and successful completion rates.

The suggested solution focuses on debugging and troubleshooting:

1. **Code Review:** Examine the code changes introduced to identify any potential bugs or unintended consequences.
2. **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs for error messages or unusual patterns around the time of the anomalies to pinpoint the source of the problem.
3. **Rollback Option:** If the impact is severe and requires immediate mitigation, consider rolling back the change to restore previous functionality while further investigation takes place.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear failure. Here's why:

* **Significant KPI Changes:** Both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` exhibit drastic shifts in their ranges and trends after the change. This suggests a significant impact on the service's core functionality.
* **SCWARN Algorithm Anomalies:** The algorithm identifying anomalies at specific timestamps points to potential events or code executions directly contributing to the failure. 

**Solution Steps:**

The solution focuses on:

1. **Identifying the Root Cause:**  Thoroughly examining code changes, SCWARN anomaly logs, and system logs is crucial for pinpointing the exact reason behind the failures.
2. **Resolving the Issue:** Once the root cause is identified, appropriate fixes can be implemented, such as correcting bugs, adjusting configurations, or modifying code behavior.
3. **Rollback as a Last Resort:** If the problem is severe and impacting users, rolling back the changes is a necessary step to restore service stability while investigating and fixing the issue.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The metrics provided do not clearly point to a failure. The system is still operational, and while there are anomalies detected, they don't necessarily translate to a severe performance issue. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** Not applicable since the change didn't result in significant KPI deviations.
* **Reason:**  The SCWARN algorithm flags anomalies, but these need further investigation. It's important to understand the context of these anomalies – are they expected behavior changes or genuine issues? The provided data suggests a potential for further analysis rather than an immediate failure.
* **Solution:** Since the change appears normal based on current metrics, no immediate solution is required. However, continued monitoring and analysis of the anomalies detected by SCWARN are crucial to ensure the system's long-term stability.

**Explanation:**

The analysis reveals that the change did not result in any significant deviations from expected behavior.  Here's why:

* **No KPI Anomalies:** The top 5 abnormal KPIs are empty because no KPIs exceeded their thresholds or displayed unusual patterns.
* **SCWARN Algorithm:** This algorithm failed to detect any anomalies, suggesting the change didn't cause unexpected system behavior.
* **KPI Ranges:** While there were some shifts in the ranges of 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate', these changes are not necessarily indicative of a failure. They could represent normal fluctuations or adjustments following the change.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Significant KPI Shifts:** The provided data clearly shows significant changes in both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` after the change. This is a strong indicator of a potential issue. 
* **Trend Reversals:** The reversal of trends (from downward to upward for `request_count`, and from upward to downward for `request_success_rate`)  suggests something substantial has altered how the system is operating.
* **Lack of Overall Anomaly Data:** While the total number of anomalies found is -1 (which seems unusual), the absence of detailed information about individual anomaly descriptions prevents a more precise assessment. However, the focus on `request_count` and `request_success_rate` anomalies is enough to raise concern.

**Important Note:** Without access to the specific code changes and system logs, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact cause. The suggested solutions aim to guide further investigation and troubleshooting.
