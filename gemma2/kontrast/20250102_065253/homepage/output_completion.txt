**Explanation:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`**  The metrics clearly indicate a negative impact after the change, warranting classification as a failure. 
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**: The two most significant KPIs affected are `request_success_rate` (dropping drastically) and `request_count` (showing unusual behavior).
* **`reason`**: A clear explanation linking the changes in these KPIs to a likely problem introduced by the change.
* **`solution`**:  Practical steps to debug and resolve the issue, focusing on code review, log analysis, and resource monitoring.

Let me break down why I classified this change as "normal":

* **No KPI Deviations:** The provided metrics show no significant deviations before and after the change.  The ranges of key performance indicators (KPIs) like `request_success_rate` and `request_count` remained within acceptable bounds.
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm didn't identify any anomalies during the analysis period. This indicates that the system's behavior remained consistent with expected patterns.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**: Classified as "failure" because key metrics like 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' show substantial deviations after the change. This indicates a negative impact on service performance.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPI**:  The provided data highlights "request_success_rate" and "request_count" as the primary KPIs experiencing anomalies.

* **Reason**: The significant drop in 'request_success_rate' and changes in 'request_count' distribution point to a problem with the service's ability to handle requests successfully. This suggests the change introduced bugs or caused unintended consequences affecting request processing.

* **Solution**: The suggested solution involves:
    1.  **Root Cause Analysis**: Carefully examine the code changes made during the deployment to identify the specific alterations that might be causing the performance issues.
    2. **Log Analysis**: Thoroughly review system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity patterns correlated with the time of the change. 
    3. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, network) during and after the deployment to pinpoint potential bottlenecks or resource exhaustion caused by the change.
    4. **Rollback Strategy**: If the situation warrants immediate action, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous working state while investigating the root cause.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in  'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. This indicates that the software changes likely introduced bugs affecting service functionality. The sudden drop to 0.0 for 'request_success_rate' is particularly alarming.",
	"solution": "1. **Roll back the recent software changes:** This will immediately restore the previous, working state of the service. 2. **Investigate the specific code changes:** Analyze the recently implemented code to identify the source of the issue.  3. **Thoroughly test the corrected code:** After fixing the bug(s), conduct rigorous testing to ensure the service functions correctly and meets performance expectations."
