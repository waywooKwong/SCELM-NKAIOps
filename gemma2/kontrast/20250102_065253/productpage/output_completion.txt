Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Metrics Within Range:**  The provided data shows that the "request_success_rate" and "request_count" KPIs remained within their historical ranges before and after the change. There are no indications of sudden increases, decreases, or shifts that would suggest a failure.
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm did not identify any anomalies during the change window. This indicates that the system's monitoring tools didn't flag any unusual behavior.

Given these factors, it's safe to classify this change as "normal".

Review logs around the anomaly timestamps for further insights. Consider rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigation strategies while investigating the issue."
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Decreased 'request_success_rate'**:  This indicates that the software is failing to successfully process a higher percentage of requests after the change. This is a strong indicator of a problem.
* **Increased 'request_count'**: While not always negative, a sudden increase in request count alongside a decrease in success rate could suggest the system is struggling to keep up or facing errors that lead to retries.
* **Anomaly Detection**: The flagged anomalies reinforce the idea that the change caused unexpected behavior patterns. This system likely has baselines for normal operation, so deviations trigger alerts.



It's crucial to investigate these issues thoroughly to pinpoint the cause and implement a fix.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Normal
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Null (No significant KPI anomalies)
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while anomalies were detected by the SCWARN algorithm, these don't directly correspond to major KPI changes. Key performance indicators like `request_success_rate` and `request_count` show relatively minor fluctuations within their expected ranges. This suggests the change didn't cause a widespread system failure. 
* **Solution:** Not applicable as the change is classified as normal based on the available data.

* **Reason:** The reduced success rate indicates failures in handling requests, while the shifted count could point to changes in request volume or processing efficiency.
* **Solution:** The proposed steps cover standard troubleshooting procedures for identifying and resolving software issues.
