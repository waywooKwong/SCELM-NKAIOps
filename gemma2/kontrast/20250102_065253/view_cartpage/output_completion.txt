}
``` 



Let me explain my reasoning:

* **'request_success_rate' dropping to 0:** This is a major red flag. It indicates that the change has caused requests to fail entirely.  
* **Shift in 'request_count':** While the range hasn't changed drastically, the trend shift suggests that something about how requests are handled has been disrupted.

These anomalies strongly suggest the change introduced a bug or issue that needs immediate attention. The provided solutions focus on identifying and fixing the problem as quickly as possible.
