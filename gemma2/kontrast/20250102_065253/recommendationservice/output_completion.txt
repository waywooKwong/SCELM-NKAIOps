	"reason": "All indicator data is within the defined threshold.",
	"solution": null
}
``` 


Let me explain why the output is classified as "normal":

* **No Threshold Exceedance:** The provided information states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal." This means the system's performance metrics are within acceptable limits.
* **Absence of Anomalies:**  The text mentions a total of 4 anomalies found and 5 anomalous KPIs. However, it also states that all indicator data is within the threshold, implying these anomalies might be minor or non-critical issues not impacting overall system health.

Because there's no evidence of significant performance degradation or exceeding thresholds, classifying this change as "normal" is appropriate.

* **reason:** The analysis highlights the negative impact of the change on system performance based on the data patterns.
* **solution:** A structured approach to troubleshooting is recommended:

    1. **Identify the Changes:**  Pinpoint the code modifications made around the time of the data shift.
    2. **Analyze the Impact:** Examine how those changes directly affect the selected KPIs (e.g., increased resource consumption, network traffic bottlenecks).
    3. **Remediation:** 
        * **Revert Changes:** If possible, revert recent code changes to see if it restores normal performance.

'istio_count'  shows a notable decrease, which could suggest problems with service communication. Finally, while 'istio_duration' hasn't drastically changed, its slight shift might be related to the other anomalies.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Network Performance:** Analyze network traffic logs and monitor bandwidth usage to identify bottlenecks or connectivity issues affecting 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet'.\n2. **Review Service Communication Logs:** Examine logs for 'istio_count' to pinpoint potential errors or delays in service interactions.\n3. **Monitor System Resources:**  Closely watch CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk I/O on the affected servers to rule out resource contention issues impacting 'cpu_usage'.\n4. **Check Configuration Settings:** Verify that relevant configuration settings for network, load balancing, and service discovery are accurate and optimized.\n5. **Consider Scaling:** If resource constraints are identified, explore scaling options for affected components (e.g., adding more servers) to improve performance."

Let me know if you'd like to explore what happens when the data indicates a failure!  We can then adjust the response accordingly.
