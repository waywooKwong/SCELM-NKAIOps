}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided metrics data clearly indicates a failure. Both `request_duration` and `request_count` exhibit abnormal behavior after the change.  

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The two most crucial KPIs are:
    * `request_duration`: This metric drastically increased in range, suggesting slowdowns or processing bottlenecks introduced by the change.
    * `request_count`: A significant decrease in this metric implies that fewer requests are being processed successfully, potentially due to errors or issues handling incoming traffic.

* **Reason:** The abnormal behavior of these KPIs strongly suggests a problem with the implemented changes. They point towards performance degradation and difficulties in processing requests after the update.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to identify and fix the issue:
    1. **Code Review:** Carefully examine the code changes made during the service update to pinpoint the specific lines or functions that might be causing the problems.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Thoroughly analyze system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that occurred around the time of the change. This can provide valuable clues about what went wrong.
    3. **Rollback (If Possible):**  If feasible and the impact is not severe, consider reverting the recent changes to restore the previous state while investigating the issue further.
    4. **Temporary Workarounds:**  Implement temporary solutions to mitigate the immediate impact of the problems, such as adjusting resource allocation or configuring fallback mechanisms.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No Threshold Exceedances:** The provided text explicitly states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold." This is a key indicator of a normal change.
* **Absence of Negative Symptoms:**  There's no mention of significant performance degradation (system latency, error rates, uptime), new log patterns indicating errors, or any other symptoms suggesting failure.

Since the metrics are within expected ranges and there are no signs of problems, the classification is "normal."

**Explanation:**

The data clearly shows a significant deviation in  `request_duration` and `request_count` after the change.

**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a "failure" change based on the following:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show drastic shifts in their data ranges after the change. This strongly suggests that the system's performance has been negatively impacted.
* **Performance Degradation:** The increase in `request_duration` implies slower response times, while the decrease in `request_count` might indicate issues with processing requests or a potential service outage.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show drastic shifts after the change, indicating a problem. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "request_duration" and "request_count" are the most significant indicators of failure due to their large range changes.
* **Reason:** The  provided data clearly shows that the 'request_duration' and 'request_count' KPIs have moved significantly outside their normal ranges after the change, suggesting a service degradation.

* **Solution:** The proposed solutions focus on:
    * **Code Review:** Identifying potential bugs or misconfigurations introduced by recent changes.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Finding clues about what happened during the anomaly timestamps (13:32:00 and 19:58:00) to understand their connection to the 'Deleting White List' incident.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Checking if system resources are overloaded and causing performance issues.
    * **Rollback:** As a last resort, reverting changes to the previous state can help isolate the problem.

After the change, 'request_duration' showed an increased range with negative values and a downward trend, while 'request_count' shifted to a smaller range and an upward trend. This indicates potential issues with service performance and request handling.",
	"solution": "Investigate the configuration changes made during this deployment, particularly those related to whitelisting.  Review logs for errors or warnings that occurred around the time of the change. Consider reverting to the previous configuration or applying a rollback strategy to restore normal service operation. Further analysis of the code changes and system logs is required to pinpoint the exact cause of the anomalies."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_duration, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as request_duration and request_count. The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or configuration issue.  The sudden increase in request_duration and decrease in request_count suggest potential performance degradation and service disruption.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Review logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the anomalous KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations. \n5. **Engage with developers:** Collaborate with developers to understand the intended behavior of the changes and identify potential solutions to address the anomalies."
}
``` 


Let me break down why I've classified this as a "failure":

* **Drastic Data Range Shifts:** The provided data clearly shows that the ranges for `request_duration` and `request_count` have changed dramatically after the change was implemented.  This indicates something significant happened within the system.
* **Unexpected Trends:** A sudden increase in `request_duration` (meaning requests are taking longer) combined with a decrease in `request_count` (fewer requests being made) is unusual and points to potential issues.

**Important Considerations for Further Investigation:**

While these indicators suggest a failure, it's crucial to:

1. **Examine the Code Changes:** The developers need to carefully review the recent code changes to pinpoint what might have caused these shifts in behavior.
2. **Analyze Logs:** System logs can provide valuable clues about errors, warnings, or resource contention that occurred around the time of the change. 



Let me know if you have any more details about the system or the specific changes made – this could help narrow down the potential causes.
