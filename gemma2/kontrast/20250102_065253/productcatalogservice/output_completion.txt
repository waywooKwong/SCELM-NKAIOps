``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Thresholds:** Your provided context mentions "indicator data does not exceed the threshold." This implies that there are predefined limits for each KPI.  Since none of the values breach these limits, it suggests normal behavior.

* **Absence of Critical KPIs:** You specifically request to exclude KPIs named with "build". If this is a significant category related to deployment or build processes, and they remain within acceptable ranges, it further supports a "normal" classification.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_count, memory_usage, diskio",
	"reason": "There are significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. CPU usage increased,  istio_count rose sharply, memory usage decreased but with a larger range, and diskio showed an unexpected spike.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased CPU usage and istio_count. Optimize resource allocation for the system. Analyze the decrease in memory usage and determine if it's due to process changes or potential memory leaks. Monitor the diskio spike and identify any bottlenecks or excessive I/O operations."
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **CPU Usage Increase:** A significant increase in CPU usage indicates that the system is working harder than usual, which could be a sign of inefficient code, resource contention, or increased load.
* **Istio_Count Rise:** An abrupt rise in `istio_count` suggests potential issues with service mesh traffic routing or communication. This needs further investigation to understand if it's due to increased requests, configuration changes, or errors within the Istio implementation.
* **Memory Usage Shift:** While memory usage decreased, the larger range indicates potential instability or fluctuations that require attention. It might be a symptom of processes consuming more or less memory unpredictably.
* **Diskio Spike:** A sudden spike in diskio can point to bottlenecks in data access or storage operations. This needs to be investigated to identify the cause and optimize I/O performance.

Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Memory usage & CPU usage:** The sharp decrease in both memory usage and CPU usage is unusual. This could indicate a problem where parts of your application are no longer actively used or that the code change has introduced inefficiencies.
* **istio_duration:** A significant increase in `istio_duration` suggests delays or slowdowns within your service mesh (Istio). This could be due to misconfigured routing rules, overloaded components, or network issues.

**Important Notes:**

* The provided data is limited.  To give a more precise diagnosis, we'd need logs, application traces, and details about the change that was made.
* "Failure" is a broad term. This analysis suggests potential problems requiring further investigation. It doesn't necessarily mean the entire system has crashed or stopped functioning.

Let me break down why these changes indicate a failure:

* **cpu_usage:**  A sharp decrease in CPU usage might seem positive initially, but often indicates that a process is not utilizing available resources efficiently. This could signal a bottleneck elsewhere or an application issue.
* **istio_duration:** A significant increase in Istio duration means requests are taking longer to be processed within your service mesh. This can directly impact user experience and application performance.  
* **memory_usage:** The increase in memory usage suggests that the system is under more strain after the change. This could lead to performance degradation or even crashes if unchecked.

* **diskio:** A large decrease in disk I/O might indicate a problem with data access patterns or a shift in workload that is not being handled efficiently.
* **istio_count:** An increase in Istio count could suggest an increased number of requests or a change in traffic patterns that the service mesh is struggling to handle.
