	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_duration' and 'request_count'. The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change. 'request_duration' shows a significantly increased maximum value and a shift in the overall trend, while 'request_count' exhibits both a decrease in minimum and maximum values and a change in the overall trend.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Investigate anomaly points:** Focus on the specific time points (03:22:00, 08:06:00, 10:56:00, 13:52:00) where anomalies were detected. Analyze system activity and logs during these periods to pinpoint potential causes. \n4. **Monitor system performance:**  Continuously monitor 'request_duration' and 'request_count' after implementing any changes to ensure the KPIs stabilize and return to normal ranges."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis of the provided data points towards a "failure" classification due to the following reasons:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show substantial changes in their data ranges after the change. This indicates a disruption in normal system behavior.
* **Trend Shifts:** The overall trends of both KPIs have changed, suggesting a fundamental alteration in how the system operates. 
* **Anomaly Points:**  The presence of anomaly points (specific times) further highlights periods of unusual activity that require investigation.

**Explanation:**

The provided data shows that  `request_duration` and `request_count` KPI values changed after the implementation. However, these changes don't necessarily indicate a failure. There is no information about predefined thresholds or expected ranges for these KPIs. Additionally, the analysis states there were no anomalies detected by the monitoring system.

Therefore, based on the available information, the change appears to be normal.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly shows a significant shift in the behavior of "request_duration" and "request_count" after the change.  These are crucial KPIs for understanding system performance, so this deviation strongly suggests an issue.  

While the specific cause needs investigation (as outlined in the solution), it's safe to classify this as a "failure" based on the observable data.

**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear failure:

* **Significant Data Range Shifts:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show substantial changes in their data ranges after the change.  
* **Unrealistic Values:**  A `request_duration` exceeding 16 seconds is highly unusual and suggests a problem with processing or service response time.
* **Decrease in Requests:** A decrease in `request_count` could indicate a broken functionality or a misconfiguration that's preventing users from accessing the service.

The "Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" incident further reinforces the possibility of a configuration issue causing these failures.

**Analysis Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a "failure" change.  Here's why:

* **Dramatic Shifts in KPI Ranges:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show extreme changes in their data ranges after the change. This suggests a major disruption in how the system is functioning.
* **Uncharacteristic Values:** The `request_duration` now includes values exceeding 15 seconds, which is highly unusual if it was previously within a much narrower range. This points to potential performance issues or bottlenecks introduced by the change.

* **Decreased Request Count:** A significant drop in `request_count` could indicate problems with how the system is handling requests or serving content.  It's worth investigating whether users are encountering errors or the system itself is experiencing issues.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": null,
	"reason": "The provided data indicates no significant anomalies in KPIs. While there are changes in the range and trend of 'request_duration' and 'request_count' after the change, these are within expected bounds and do not indicate a failure. The absence of flagged anomalies by the SCWARN algorithm further supports this assessment.",
	"solution": null 
}
```  


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "normal"**: The data provided shows no clear signs of a detrimental impact from the change. KPIs are within acceptable ranges, and there are no major deviations flagged by the SCWARN algorithm.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi": null**: Since there are no identified anomalies, this field remains empty.
* **reason**:  The analysis focuses on the lack of substantial changes in key performance indicators (KPIs) and the absence of alerts from the SCWARN system.
* **solution**: As the change appears to be normal, a solution is not necessary.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_duration' and 'request_count'. The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change.  'request_duration' now shows a much wider range, with values exceeding 26 seconds, while 'request_count' has decreased significantly.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Investigate the 'Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes' incident:** This incident description suggests a potential configuration issue that could be causing the observed KPI changes. Focus on rectifying any misconfigurations related to request handling and whitelisting.\n4. **Monitor system resources:** Check CPU, memory, and network utilization to identify if any resource constraints are contributing to the performance degradation. \n5. **Rollback or revert the change:** If possible, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state and investigate further once the system is stable."
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a drastic shift after the change, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "request_duration" and "request_count" are the primary KPIs affected by the change.
* **Reason:** The KPIs indicate a significant increase in request duration (values exceeding 26 seconds) and a decrease in request count. This suggests potential issues with request processing, resource contention, or configuration errors.

The provided incident description ("Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes") strongly points towards a configuration issue as the root cause.
