**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on key metrics ('request_success_rate' and 'request_count') after the change. This, coupled with SCWARN algorithm flags, strongly indicates a failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  The most significant anomalies are in 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'.
* **reason**: The decrease in 'request_success_rate' directly points to the system struggling to handle requests successfully. The shift in 'request_count' distribution could be a symptom of this issue or indicate other problems. 
* **solution**:  The suggested steps focus on:
    * **Reversing the change:** Quickly restore the previous state to mitigate ongoing damage.
    * **Code review and debugging:** Identify the specific code changes that caused the issues.
    * **Logging analysis:** Examine system logs for clues about errors or unusual behavior.
    * **Continuous monitoring:**  Keep a close eye on 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' after implementing fixes to ensure stability.
    * **Collaboration with developers:** Work closely with the development team to understand the intended outcome of the changes and find a lasting solution.

**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear failure based on the following:

* **Decreased `request_success_rate`**: This strongly suggests problems with the service's ability to successfully handle requests.
* **Shifted `request_count` trend**:  A change in request count pattern could indicate unexpected behavior or issues in how the service responds to requests.
* **SCWARN algorithm flag**: The use of an anomaly detection system (SCWARN) further supports the classification as a failure, as it automatically identified problematic data patterns.

{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations after the change. `request_success_rate` experienced a downward level shift, indicating a decrease in successful requests.  Simultaneously, `request_count` displayed a steady increase, suggesting a higher volume of requests despite the lower success rate. This combination points to potential issues with the service's ability to handle the increased request load.",
	"solution": "Investigate the cause of the decreased success rate in `request_success_rate`.  This could involve examining server logs, monitoring resource utilization, and reviewing recent code changes. Optimize the system to handle the increased `request_count` more efficiently by scaling resources or improving performance bottlenecks."
}
``` 


Let me break down why I arrived at this conclusion:

* **Decreased Success Rate:** A significant drop in `request_success_rate`  is a major red flag. It means the service is failing to fulfill a larger portion of incoming requests.
* **Increasing Request Volume:** The simultaneous increase in `request_count` suggests that users are still trying to use the service, even though it's less reliable. This puts additional strain on the system and could exacerbate performance issues.

**The combination of these factors strongly indicates a failure.**

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure:

* **Negative `request_success_rate`**: This is highly unusual and suggests that requests are failing consistently.
* **Drastic shift in `request_count`**: A sudden change in request volume could indicate an issue with the system's ability to handle traffic or a misconfiguration. 
* **SCAM (Sudden Change Anomalies):** The "Still in abnormal state" anomaly descriptions highlight that these issues persist after the change was implemented.

Therefore, the `change_type` is classified as "failure". The solution focuses on:

1. **Undoing the change:**  A rollback is the quickest way to restore stability.
2. **Debugging:** Identifying the root cause of the issue is crucial. This involves reviewing code changes and analyzing logs.
3. **Monitoring:** Continuously tracking system performance helps in identifying further problems and assessing the effectiveness of the solution.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:**  The provided metrics clearly indicate a negative impact following the change. Both 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' have shifted downwards, which is not expected in a normal scenario.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The two most critical KPIs are 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. These directly reflect the health and performance of the service.
* **Reason:**  The decrease in 'request_success_rate' suggests problems with handling requests correctly, leading to failures. The reduction in 'request_count' might indicate users experiencing issues and abandoning interactions with the service.
* **Solution:** The recommended steps involve a thorough code review to identify the root cause of the issue. Logging analysis can help pinpoint specific error points or unusual behavior patterns. Temporary fixes should be implemented if possible to restore service functionality while a permanent solution is developed.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The change negatively impacted key metrics like 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'.  The SCWARN algorithm also flagged anomalies, strongly suggesting a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  While there are more than 5 KPIs mentioned, the most impactful are 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. These directly reflect the system's ability to handle requests successfully.
* **reason:** The decrease in 'request_success_rate' and the shift in 'request_count' distribution point to problems in how requests are processed or handled.  The SCWARN algorithm's confirmation strengthens this conclusion.
* **solution:** A multi-pronged approach is recommended:

    1. **Rollback:** This immediately reverts to a known working state, minimizing downtime and allowing for investigation.
    2. **Code Review:** Identifying the specific code changes made can pinpoint the source of the problem.
    3. **Log Analysis:** System logs often provide valuable clues about errors or unexpected behavior during the change.
    4. **KPI Monitoring:**  Continue tracking these KPIs closely to see if the issue persists or reoccurs after implementing solutions. 
    5. **Developer Collaboration:** Working with developers ensures a coordinated effort to understand and fix the root cause.

While the provided data doesn't specify the magnitude of deviation, any significant drop in success rate or change in request count suggests a problem. The 'newly generated log pattern' mentioned further strengthens this suspicion.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Logs:** Analyze the new log pattern for clues about the failure cause. Look for error messages, unusual patterns, or resource bottlenecks. 2. **Roll Back:** If possible, revert to the previous version of the software to restore normal operation. This will allow for further investigation in a stable environment. 3. **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the changes made to identify potential bugs or misconfigurations. Pay close attention to network configurations and interactions with other systems. 4. **Monitor Closely:**  After implementing any fixes, monitor the metrics closely to ensure the problem is resolved and there are no unforeseen side effects."
