{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, cpu_usage, net_send_packet, memory_usage",
	"reason": "The metrics show significant deviations after the change.  \n* `istio_success_rate` dropped drastically.\n* `istio_duration` increased significantly with a much wider range.\n * `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, and `memory_usage`  also experienced notable changes, indicating potential resource issues.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **`change_type`: "failure"`** - The data strongly suggests a failure because several key metrics show significant negative changes post-change.

* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`**:  These are the KPIs with the most drastic shifts, suggesting they're at the heart of the problem:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A large drop means requests through Istio are failing more often.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration indicates delays in handling requests, likely due to bottlenecks or errors introduced by the change.
    *  `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, and `memory_usage`: These all show changes, suggesting resource contention might be a factor.

* **`reason`**: This explains *why* the change is considered a failure based on the metric data.

* **`solution`**: Practical steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:
    1. **Focus on Istio:** Since `istio_success_rate` and `istio_duration` are affected, investigate any recent changes related to Istio configuration or services using it.
    2. **Error Logging:** Check logs for any errors specifically during the time period when these metrics worsened. This could pinpoint the source of the problem.
    3. **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor CPU, network, and memory usage after implementing fixes to ensure the issue is truly resolved.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, istio_duration, net_send_packet, memory_usage",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' drops dramatically, 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' decrease, while 'istio_duration' increases, suggesting potential performance issues or configuration problems.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made and their impact on these KPIs.

Consider reverting the changes or implementing fixes to restore normal performance."
}
``` 



Let me break down why this classification was made:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The changes in 'istio_success_rate', 'cpu_usage', 'memory_usage', 'istio_duration', and 'net_send_packet' are not minor fluctuations. They indicate a potential problem.
* **Negative Impacts:** A drop in success rate ('istio_success_rate') and an increase in duration ('istio_duration') strongly suggest issues with service requests being processed correctly or efficiently within the Istio mesh. 
* **Resource Usage Shift:** The decrease in 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' could be misleading. It might indicate that processes are not utilizing resources as expected, potentially due to errors or inefficient code execution.


**Important Next Steps:**

1. **Code Review:** Scrutinize the recent code changes related to the affected components. Look for potential bugs, misconfigurations, or unintended side effects.
2. **Log Analysis:** Analyze logs from the application, Istio, and any relevant infrastructure components. Search for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that correlate with the time of the change.
3. **Monitoring Tools:** Utilize monitoring tools to track key performance indicators in real-time. This can help pinpoint the exact nature and source of the problem.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the described changes point to a potential system problem, not just normal fluctuations. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** Selected based on the severity and impact of their changes:
    * `istio_success_rate`:  A drastic drop indicates significant communication failures within the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased request processing times can lead to slow responses and user frustration.
    * `memory_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `cpu_usage`: These metrics trending upwards suggest resource strain and potential performance bottlenecks. 

* **reason:**  The combined changes point to a likely failure scenario where the system is struggling to handle its workload efficiently. This could be due to various factors like increased traffic, misconfiguration, or underlying infrastructure issues.
* **solution:** Focuses on investigating the primary suspect (`istio_duration`) and then addressing potential resource constraints through scaling or optimization.  Monitoring the key metrics will help identify further issues and track progress.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_send_packet, cpu_usage, memory_usage",
	"reason": "Several key KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' drops sharply, 'istio_duration' has an unusually wide range with both high and low values, and 'net_send_packet', 'cpu_usage', and 'memory_usage' all exhibit changes outside normal operating parameters. This suggests a problem with the deployed change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the source of the issue. Review logs for error messages or performance bottlenecks around the time of the change. Monitor these KPIs closely after implementing any fixes." 
}
```  


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant and negative changes in several key metrics (istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_send_packet, cpu_usage, memory_usage) strongly indicate a failure.  

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the most affected metrics, pointing directly to potential problems with communication (istio_success_rate and istio_duration), network throughput (net_send_packet), resource utilization (cpu_usage and memory_usage).

* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the changes have caused a deviation from normal behavior in critical performance indicators.  

* **Solution:** The recommended steps are focused on troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Look for specific issues introduced by the recent changes.
    * **Log Analysis:** Search for error messages or performance warnings correlated with the change. 
    * **Continuous Monitoring:** Keep a close eye on these KPIs after implementing any fixes to ensure stability.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, memory_usage, istio_duration, net_send_packet, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The `istio_success_rate` dropped significantly after the change, indicating potential issues with service communication.  Furthermore, `memory_usage` decreased and `cpu_usage` remained stable, suggesting inefficient resource utilization. The `istio_duration` increased, hinting at slower service requests. Finally, `net_send_packet` also showed a decrease in values, potentially due to communication issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased `istio_success_rate`. Analyze memory and CPU usage patterns to optimize resource allocation. Monitor network traffic and latency to identify potential bottlenecks.  Consider implementing logging and monitoring tools for better insights into service performance."

	"reason": "Several key KPIs show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped dramatically, 'istio_duration' increased with a downward trend, and metrics like 'net_send_packet', 'memory_usage', and 'cpu_usage'  show altered ranges compared to before the change. These indicate potential issues with service performance and resource utilization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in 'istio_success_rate' and 'istio_duration'. Analyze logs and system metrics related to network communication, resource consumption, and any recent code deployments or configuration updates. Consider reverting the change if it is causing detrimental effects." 
}
```  



**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** Set to "failure" because the provided KPI data suggests a negative impact after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These KPIs show the most significant deviations from their pre-change behavior, indicating potential problems.
* **reason:** A concise explanation connecting the observed KPI changes to potential issues with service performance and resource utilization.
* **solution:**  A suggested course of action to address the identified problems, including investigation, analysis, and possible reversion of the change.
