}
```  


Let me break down why this classification was made:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** The comparison of KPIs before and after the change shows no substantial differences. All values remain within expected ranges.
* **Zero Anomalies Detected:** The SCWARN algorithm, which monitors for anomalies, reported zero anomalies. This strongly suggests that the system behaved as expected following the change.

Since there are no indicators of performance degradation or unusual behavior, the change is deemed "normal".

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure. Here's why:

* **`request_success_rate` dropping to 0:** This is a critical indicator of failure. It means that no requests are being successfully processed after the change.
* **Shift in `request_count`:** While the overall trend might be upwards, a sudden shift in range suggests that the request processing mechanism is disrupted.

These anomalies combined point towards a serious issue introduced by the recent changes.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, indicating that the change likely introduced unexpected behavior despite similar data ranges before and after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  "request_count", "request_success_rate". These KPIs directly relate to how the system handles requests, and their deviations suggest a problem with the implemented change.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to the SCWARN algorithm's flagged anomalies as the primary concern. While overall data ranges appear similar, these specific timestamps indicate potential issues. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a combination of code review, log analysis, and potentially rolling back or mitigating the change until a permanent fix is implemented.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: "failure"**: The SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies, indicating the change likely introduced issues. Even though data ranges appear similar, anomaly detection suggests deviations from expected behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  "request_count" and "request_success_rate" are flagged as primary contributors to the failure.
* **Reason:** The SCWARN anomalies combined with potential shifts in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' point towards a problem introduced by the change. 
* **Solution:** 
    1.  **Code Review**: Thoroughly examine the code changes made to the `view_cartpage` service. Look for logic errors, incorrect data handling, or resource contention issues.
    2. **Log Analysis**: Analyze logs from around the time of the change. Search for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns related to 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.
    3. **Debugging**: Use debugging tools to step through the code execution during a request processing cycle. This can help pinpoint the exact location where the issue originates.



It's crucial to investigate further based on the specific details in your logs and system environment to determine the precise cause of the failure and implement an effective solution.

	"reason": "The metrics indicate an increase in resource contention and potential software defects post-change. The  \"Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes\" signal suggests the change has introduced issues with resource allocation or faulty code execution.",
	"solution": "1. Review the code changes made during this deployment to identify potential sources of resource contention or software defects.\n2. Monitor system logs and performance metrics closely for further insights into the nature of the issue.\n3. Consider rolling back the recent change if the problem cannot be quickly addressed.\n4. Optimize resource allocation strategies and investigate potential bottlenecks within the system."

	"reason": "The 'Resource Contention-Defective Software Changes' anomaly indicates that the change introduced problems with resource utilization, likely leading to performance degradation. This is further supported by the new log structure pattern.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes related to resource management. Profile the application to identify bottlenecks and areas of contention. Optimize resource allocation and consider implementing strategies like thread pooling or asynchronous processing."
