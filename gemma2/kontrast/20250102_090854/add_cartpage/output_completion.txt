**Explanation of the Response:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The provided data clearly shows a significant deviation in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' after the change. This indicates a negative impact on the service's performance, hence classified as a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: We list the two most significantly affected KPIs: 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.
* **reason**:  The explanation details the nature of the anomalies observed in the KPIs – widening data ranges and shifts in trends, pointing towards a malfunction or misconfiguration.
* **solution**: The suggested solutions focus on identifying the root cause of the failure: 
    * Reviewing recent code changes for potential bugs.
    * Comparing logs before and after the change to pinpoint unusual activity.
    * Investigating the 'Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors' incident, as it could directly explain the KPI anomalies.
    * Monitoring system resources to rule out any bottlenecks impacting performance.

	"solution": "" 
}
``` 



Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No Explicit Anomalies:** The analysis explicitly states "Total anomalies found: -1".  A negative anomaly count is unusual and likely an error. We should treat this with caution. 
* **Shift in Trends, Not Absolute Deviations:** While the trends for 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' changed, these shifts don't necessarily indicate a failure. It's possible the change was designed to influence these metrics. 
* **Lack of Threshold Information:**  Without knowing the acceptable ranges or thresholds for these KPIs, we can't definitively say if the changes are problematic.

**Important Next Steps:**

1. **Investigate Anomaly Count Error:** The negative anomaly count needs immediate attention. Review the SCWARN algorithm and data processing to identify the source of this error.
2. **Define KPI Thresholds:**  Establish clear thresholds for each key performance indicator to determine what constitutes a normal vs. abnormal change.
3. **Historical Data Analysis:** Compare the observed changes to historical trends for the same KPIs to better understand if they fall within expected ranges or signal a deviation. 
4. **Change Impact Review:** Consider the documented purpose of the change and whether the observed metrics align with its intended effects.

**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that, despite some data range changes post-change, there are no clear indicators of a failure. 

* **No significant degradation:** KPIs like latency, error rates, uptime, and throughput are not mentioned in the provided data, making it impossible to assess their performance impact.
* **Limited anomaly information:** The single anomaly detected (SCWARN algorithm) lacks specific details about its nature and severity. Without further context on this anomaly's impact on system behavior, it's difficult to classify it as a failure.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Data Range Shifts:** The most significant indicator is the widening range in both 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'. This suggests a greater volatility and instability in the system's behavior after the change.
* **Trend Change:** The shift from an upward trend in 'request_success_rate' to a downward trend further points towards a negative impact of the change.

* **"Deleting White List by mistake"**: While I don't have details about this incident, its mention suggests a potential root cause for the observed anomalies.  It's crucial to investigate how this event could be affecting 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.


**Therefore, based on the provided data, I classify the change as "failure".** The suggested solutions aim to pinpoint the root cause (potentially related to the white list incident) and implement corrective measures. Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure the stability of the system after any fixes are applied.

Let me break down why I classified this change as "normal":

* **Absence of Significant KPI Deviations:**  The data doesn't reveal KPIs that have drastically moved outside their historical norms. While there are slight changes in the trends of `request_count` and `request_success_rate`, these aren't necessarily indicative of a failure.
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The system reports no anomalies (`Total anomalies found: -1`). If there were critical deviations from expected behavior, anomaly detection algorithms would likely flag them.

**Important Note:** While the data suggests a normal change, it's always good practice to monitor system performance closely after any deployment to catch subtle issues that might emerge over time.
