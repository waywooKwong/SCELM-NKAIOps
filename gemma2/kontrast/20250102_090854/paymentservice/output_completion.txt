```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The provided data shows significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. KPIs like net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, and cpu_usage exhibit unusual fluctuations and exceed their normal ranges. This suggests a negative impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these KPI anomalies. This may involve reviewing recent code changes, system logs, and resource utilization. Identify and address any configuration issues or faulty components contributing to the performance degradation. Consider rolling back the change if it's recently implemented and causing severe performance problems." 
}
```  



**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The substantial deviations in KPIs clearly indicate a negative impact on system health, making this a failure.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These KPIs show the most dramatic changes post-update, pointing to potential issues in networking, resource management, and system processes.
* **reason:**  The data directly supports the "failure" classification. The KPI anomalies suggest the change introduced problems rather than improvements.
* **solution:** This provides a structured approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Identify the root cause:** Don't just fix symptoms; understand *why* KPIs are off.
    * **Review recent changes:** A new code deployment or configuration tweak is likely the culprit.
    * **Analyze logs and resource usage:** System logs often reveal errors, and monitoring tools show where resources are being consumed excessively.
    * **Consider rollback:** If the change is very recent, reverting it might be the quickest way to restore stability while deeper investigation happens.

	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  \n* `net_requests` indicate a potential spike in network traffic.\n * `diskio` shows increased disk I/O activity, which could signal storage bottlenecks.\n* `istio_count` suggests a rise in service mesh interactions, possibly due to increased load or configuration changes.\n* Both `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage`  demonstrate unusual fluctuations, hinting at resource contention or inefficient code execution.",

**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure scenario. Several key metrics have deviated significantly after the change, suggesting performance degradation or underlying issues within the system.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Failure Identification:** The `net_requests`, `diskio`, `istio_count`, `cpu_usage`, and `memory_usage` KPIs all show anomalous behavior after the change. This pattern strongly suggests a failure.
* **Reasoning:** The "reason" section explains the potential implications of these anomalies: network overload, storage bottlenecks, increased service mesh traffic, and resource contention. 
* **Solution:** The "solution" section offers actionable steps to address the identified issues.  It emphasizes investigation, optimization, monitoring, and proactive alerting to restore system stability and performance.

* **Positive and Negative Values:** The presence of both positive and negative deviations in some metrics (like 'memory_usage', 'cpu_usage') suggests complex interactions within the system that require further analysis.

**Explanation:**

* **reason:** The explanation connects the observed data changes to potential problems like resource contention, communication issues, or underlying system malfunctions. 
* **solution:**  The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to problem-solving:

    1. **Investigation:**  Log analysis, process monitoring, and network traffic inspection are crucial for identifying the specific cause.
    2. **Optimization:**  Adjusting resource allocation (CPU, memory) or tuning application performance can help mitigate strain.
    3. **Troubleshooting:** If infrastructure components (network devices, storage systems) are involved, targeted troubleshooting steps are necessary.

	"reason": "The system exceeded its threshold for memory usage and several Istio-related metrics (count, duration, success rate) showed significant deviations. CPU usage also spiked. This indicates potential resource contention or misconfiguration.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate memory leaks:** Analyze applications for memory leaks that might be contributing to the high memory usage. \n2. **Optimize Istio configuration:** Review Istio settings and traffic routing rules to ensure efficient resource utilization. Consider adjusting timeout values, retries, and service mesh settings.\n3. **Monitor system resources closely:** Implement robust monitoring of CPU, memory, and network usage to identify trends and potential issues early on.\n4. **Scale infrastructure as needed:** If resource demands consistently exceed available capacity, consider scaling up your infrastructure by adding more servers or containers."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration, cpu_usage, istio_success_rate",
	"reason": "Multiple key metrics show significant deviations from normal behavior.  Memory usage and CPU usage spiked dramatically, while Istio success rate decreased. This suggests a potential performance bottleneck or issue with the service mesh.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate resource consumption: Analyze logs and system metrics to pinpoint the cause of the memory and CPU spikes. Consider scaling resources if necessary.\n2. Troubleshoot Istio issues: Examine Istio configuration, traffic flow, and error logs for potential problems. Check for misconfigured gateways or service endpoints.\n3. Monitor performance: Implement robust monitoring with alerts for key metrics like latency, request rate, and error rates. This will help detect future issues proactively."
