**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the metrics analysis reveals anomalies.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "request_count" and "request_success_rate" are identified as the primary abnormal KPIs.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly indicates a deviation from expected behavior. The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies, and the KPIs "request_count" and "request_success_rate" show unusual trends compared to their pre-change patterns.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation to pinpoint the source of the problem. This includes examining the code changes, reviewing system logs, and potentially reverting the change if necessary.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the metrics 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' show anomalies after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' are the primary anomalies.
* **Reason:** The anomalies in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' indicate a decline in the service's performance.  
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes to pinpoint the source of the problem and implement a fix.

Review logs and system metrics to pinpoint the specific areas where the change might be impacting request volume.

}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning:

* **Change Type:**  We classify this as a "failure" because the change introduced a noticeable deviation in the expected behavior of the system. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPI:** The primary abnormal KPI is "request_count". The shift from a downward trend to an upward trend after the change is a significant indicator of a potential issue.
* **Reason:** The increase in "request_count" suggests that the change might be inadvertently causing more requests to be generated, potentially overloading the system.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic investigation to pinpoint the root cause of the increased requests. This could involve:
    * **Code Review:** Carefully examining the code changes made during the deployment to identify any logic errors or unintended consequences that might be driving the increased request volume.
    * **Log Analysis:** Reviewing system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that could shed light on the cause of the increased requests.
    * **Metrics Monitoring:** Closely monitoring system performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic, to identify any bottlenecks or resource constraints that might be exacerbated by the increased request load.
