**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly show a deviation from the expected behavior. The 'request_success_rate' dropping to 0% and the 'request_count' shifting to a wider range with negative values are strong indicators of a failure.
* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** The two most significant KPIs are 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' as they directly reflect the homepage service's functionality.
* **Reason:** The change likely introduced a bug or configuration error that disrupts the homepage service's ability to process requests correctly.
* **Solution:** A systematic investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. This involves:
    * **Code Review:** Examining the recent changes to the homepage service for potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:** Scrutinizing logs around the anomaly timestamps for error messages, exceptions, or unusual patterns.
    * **Database Checks:** Verifying the integrity of the database and ensuring the homepage service can access and process data correctly.

Analyze the increased request count to determine if it's due to a surge in traffic or an issue with the service's responsiveness. Consider rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigation strategies to restore normal service operation."

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in the 'request_success_rate' and an unexpected increase in 'request_count'. This suggests the change may have introduced errors or issues in processing requests, leading to failed requests and potentially causing the system to handle more requests.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during the 'homepage' service update. Review logs and error reports for any patterns related to failed requests. Analyze the 'request_count' increase to determine if it's due to legitimate traffic or potential issues with request handling. Consider rolling back the change or implementing a temporary fix to restore normal service operation."
