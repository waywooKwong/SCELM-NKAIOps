	"reason": "The provided data shows no significant deviations or anomalies beyond expected fluctuations. All KPI values fall within acceptable ranges and do not indicate any major service disruptions or performance issues.",

	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations or anomalies detected. The 'net_send_packet' KPI shows a 'Level shift up' anomaly, but this is the only anomaly reported and doesn't indicate a widespread system failure.",
	"solution": "None required"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no major performance degradations.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "None" because while there's a single anomaly, it doesn't point to a widespread failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis focuses on the absence of significant KPI deviations, despite a single 'Level shift up' anomaly in 'net_send_packet'. This anomaly might require further investigation, but it's not indicative of a system-wide failure.
* **Solution:** No solution is needed as the change doesn't appear to have caused a failure.
