**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  "normal" because the analysis shows KPIs are within expected ranges and there's no indication of a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  "N/A" because there are no abnormal KPIs identified.
* **reason:** The analysis clearly states that the KPIs are within normal ranges and there are no signs of issues.
* **solution:** "N/A" because no issues were found, so no solution is required.

	"reason": "The KPIs show significant deviations after the change. istio_duration increased significantly, istio_success_rate showed a large upward shift, and CPU and memory usage both spiked.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs demonstrate clear negative changes post-change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs reflect the most significant deviations:
    * **istio_duration:** Increased significantly, suggesting issues with request processing times.
    * **istio_success_rate:**  A large upward shift could indicate errors are now being handled differently, potentially masking underlying issues.
    * **cpu_usage and memory_usage:** Both spiked, indicating the system is under heavier load.
    * **net_recv_packet:** Increased, suggesting a change in network traffic patterns.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests a failure. Increased duration, potential error handling changes, and resource spikes all point to a problem.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific code changes responsible for the issues.
    * **Log and Resource Analysis:** Examining system logs and resource usage to pinpoint the source of the problems.
    * **Mitigation:**  
        * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous state.
        * **Optimization:**  If rollback isn't feasible, optimize the code to reduce resource consumption and improve performance.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The KPIs show clear negative changes after the change, indicating a system degradation. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five most impactful KPIs are selected based on the severity and nature of the changes.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly connects the abnormal KPIs to potential problems:
    * `istio_success_rate`:  Requests are failing more often.
    * `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage`: The system is using less resources, which could be a sign of issues or underutilization.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`: Network performance is impacted.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging and fixing the problematic areas identified by the KPIs.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The analysis clearly shows a significant negative impact on key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. This points to a "failure" as the change type.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_duration`: A large increase indicates requests are taking significantly longer to process.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A decrease implies a higher failure rate for requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased CPU consumption suggests the system is under heavy load.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory usage could indicate memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests a failure. The increased resource usage and performance degradation are symptoms of a problem introduced by the change.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issues and taking corrective actions. This could involve:
    * Analyzing logs and system metrics for clues about the problem.
    * Scaling up resources (CPU, memory) if needed.
