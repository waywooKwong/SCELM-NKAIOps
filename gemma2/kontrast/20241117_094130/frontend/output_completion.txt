**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp drop indicates potential communication issues within the service mesh.
    * `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`: Fluctuations suggest network problems.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration means requests are taking longer to process, likely due to network or service-related issues.
    * `memory_usage`: A decrease could be a symptom of the other issues or a separate problem.
* **Reason:** The combination of KPIs points to a failure related to network connectivity, communication between services (possibly due to the Istio service mesh), and potential performance bottlenecks. 
* **Solution:** The proposed solution outlines steps to investigate the root cause of the failure and address the issues. This includes checking network connectivity, analyzing logs, monitoring system resources, reviewing recent code changes, and potentially rolling back the change.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly shows a significant negative impact on several key KPIs after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A dramatic drop suggests problems with successful communication between services.
    * `istio_duration`:  A large increase in the range indicates delays or issues with service call processing.
    * `net_recv_packet` and `net_send_packet`: Changes in these metrics point to potential network connectivity or communication issues.
    * `istio_count`: While the trend is still upward, the magnitude of the change warrants investigation.
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these KPI changes strongly suggests a failure. The changes in communication-related metrics (istio) and network metrics (net_recv_packet, net_send_packet) are particularly concerning.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issues.  Reversing the change might be a temporary fix, but a more sustainable solution involves understanding the underlying problem and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The substantial drop in 'istio_success_rate', the increase in 'istio_duration', and the fluctuations in 'net_send_packet', 'istio_count', and 'memory_usage' clearly indicate a failure. These metrics point to problems with network communication, service performance, and resource utilization.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen because they represent critical aspects of system health and performance. The significant deviations in their values strongly suggest a failure.
* **Reason:** The provided data and analysis clearly demonstrate that the change resulted in a noticeable decline in system performance and stability. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the code changes made during the period of the anomaly to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that might provide clues about the cause of the failure.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, consider rolling back the change to restore the system to a stable state while further investigation is conducted.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement temporary measures to minimize the impact of the failure on users or critical operations while a permanent solution is being developed.

'istio_success_rate' decreased sharply, 'memory_usage' decreased significantly, and 'istio_duration' increased, indicating potential issues with service performance and resource utilization. The increase in 'net_recv_packet' and 'istio_count' might be related to the system trying to compensate for the performance degradation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased 'istio_success_rate' and increased 'istio_duration'. Analyze the memory usage drop and potential resource constraints. Review logs and system configurations to identify any changes that might have negatively impacted the service performance. Consider optimizing resource allocation, network configurations, and code for improved efficiency and stability."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) following the change.  'istio_success_rate' shows a drastic decrease, 'istio_duration' exhibits a large increase, and 'net_recv_packet', 'net_send_packet', and 'istio_count' show altered ranges indicating potential communication issues. The SCWARN algorithm also flagged anomalies, suggesting unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the root cause of the 'istio_success_rate' decrease.** This could involve examining network connectivity, service health, or configuration issues within the Istio service mesh. 2. **Analyze the 'istio_duration' increase.**  Look for bottlenecks or performance regressions in the services communicating through Istio. 3. **Review the changes made to the service and identify potential impacts on network communication.**  4. **Monitor the affected KPIs closely and correlate them with system logs to pinpoint the exact source of the anomalies.** 5. **Consider rolling back the change if the issues cannot be quickly resolved.**"

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided KPI data clearly indicates a negative impact on system performance after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **'istio_success_rate'**: A significant decrease suggests problems with service communication within the Istio mesh.
    * **'istio_duration'**: A large increase indicates slowdowns or delays in service requests.
    * **'net_recv_packet', 'net_send_packet'**:  Changes in these network metrics point to potential communication issues.
    * **'istio_count'**: An altered range could signal changes in service call patterns.
* **Reason:** The combination of KPI deviations and anomaly detection by SCWARN strongly suggests that the change introduced problems.
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions focus on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific cause of the issues.
    * **Performance Tuning:** Addressing bottlenecks and performance regressions.
    * **Change Rollback:** As a last resort if the issues are severe and cannot be quickly resolved.
