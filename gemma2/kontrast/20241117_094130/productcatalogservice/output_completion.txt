**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that the changes did not result in any significant negative impacts on the system's performance.  Here's why:

* **No KPI Exceeding Thresholds:**  The data explicitly states that no indicator data exceeded the threshold, meaning all KPIs stayed within acceptable ranges.
* **Stable Performance:** The descriptions of the KPIs before and after the change show trends that are consistent with normal operation. 
* **Absence of Anomaly Reports:** The system did not flag any anomalies, suggesting the change did not introduce unexpected behavior.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The analysis highlights `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `istio_count`, `istio_duration`, and `net_recv_packet` as the most significant indicators of failure.
* **Reason:** The increased resource usage (`memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`), unusual spikes in Istio-related metrics (`istio_count`, `istio_duration`), and the change in network packet reception (`net_recv_packet`) all suggest that the change introduced problems.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation to pinpoint the source of the issues and potentially rolling back the changes if the impact is severe.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" - The KPIs haven't shown significant deviations from their expected ranges, and the anomalies detected are transient and recovered. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" -  As the change type is "normal", there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The analysis focuses on the absence of significant performance degradation. While anomalies were detected, they fall under the "Recover to normal state" category, implying they were temporary fluctuations and didn't cause lasting impact.
* **Solution:**  Since the change is classified as normal, no specific solution is required.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative impacts after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The five KPIs with the most significant changes are:
    * `memory_usage`: Decreased, indicating potential memory leaks or inefficient memory allocation.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased, suggesting the change is demanding more processing power.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, implying issues with service communication and latency.
    * `istio_count`: Increased, potentially indicating more frequent service calls due to the change.
    * `diskio`: Increased, suggesting the change is causing more disk I/O operations.
* **Reason:** The combination of these changes points to a performance regression caused by the update. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Pinpointing the specific code changes responsible for the performance issues.
    * **Reversal or Optimization:** Either reverting the problematic changes or implementing code optimizations to improve efficiency.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continuously monitoring the KPIs after implementing any solutions to ensure the issue is resolved and system performance is stable.
