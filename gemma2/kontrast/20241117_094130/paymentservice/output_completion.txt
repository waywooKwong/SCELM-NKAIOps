	"reason": "The provided data indicates no significant deviations in KPIs after the change.  All indicator data remain within expected thresholds.  The 'cpu_usage' KPI exhibited a single spike anomaly, but this recovered to normal state and did not indicate persistent abnormal behavior.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because KPIs stayed within historical norms and there were no major performance degradations.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "N/A" because there were no persistent abnormal KPIs identified.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while a single spike occurred in 'cpu_usage', it was transient and didn't lead to sustained abnormal behavior. Other KPIs like 'net_send_packet', 'diskio', 'istio_success_rate', 'memory_usage', 'istio_count', and 'istio_duration'  showed no significant changes or deviations.
* **Solution:** Not applicable since the change was classified as normal.

**Explanation:**

The analysis clearly states that there are no significant KPI deviations or critical anomalies detected. The  "SCWARN" algorithm, which is designed to identify anomalies, did not flag any issues.  Since the metrics remain within expected ranges and there are no signs of system disruption, the change is classified as "normal."

    * **net_send_packet:** Increased variability and higher values suggest network communication issues.
    * **diskio:**  Increased activity could indicate disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * **memory_usage:** Higher memory consumption might point to memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * **istio_count:** More frequent requests processed by Istio indicate potential issues with routing or service discovery.
    * **istio_duration:** Longer request processing times suggest performance bottlenecks within the Istio service mesh.

* **Reason:** The significant changes in these KPIs strongly indicate that the deployment negatively affected the system's performance.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to identify and address the root cause:
    * **Code Review:** Analyze the code changes to pinpoint the areas most likely to have caused the performance issues.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous stable state.

This could involve analyzing system logs, resource utilization, and application code for potential bottlenecks. 2. Monitor the network traffic closely, particularly net_send_packet, to identify any unusual patterns or spikes that may be contributing to the performance issues. 3. Review the diskio metrics and ensure that there is sufficient storage space available and that disk operations are efficient. 4. Analyze the istio_count and istio_duration metrics to identify any issues with service communication or latency. 5. Consider scaling up resources or optimizing the application code to handle the increased load."

}
```
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, and istio_duration show abnormal increases and decreases outside historical norms. This suggests the change negatively impacted system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes implemented during this submission. Focus on areas related to network communication, disk I/O, memory management, and Istio integration.  Review logs and system events around the timestamps of the anomalies for further clues. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing mitigations to address the performance degradation."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The listed KPIs demonstrate the most significant changes, indicating a system-wide impact.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the abnormal changes in KPIs, pointing to a negative impact on system performance.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Code Review:** Examine the code changes made during the submission period.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize logs and system events around the anomaly timestamps for insights.
    3. **Rollback:**  Consider reverting the changes if possible to restore stability.
    4. **Mitigations:** If a rollback is not feasible, implement measures to address the performance issues identified.
