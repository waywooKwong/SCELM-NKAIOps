{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, istio_count, diskio, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant performance degradation. Key indicators like 'istio_success_rate' dropped sharply, 'net_send_packet' and 'istio_count' show abnormal fluctuations, 'diskio' usage is now at zero, and 'cpu_usage' decreased significantly. These combined factors indicate a failure.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The chosen KPIs reflect the most severe impacts:
    * **`istio_success_rate`:** A sharp drop suggests problems with service communication or request handling.
    * **`net_send_packet`:** Fluctuations indicate potential network issues or misconfigurations.
    * **`istio_count`:**  Abnormal changes could point to problems with service invocation or routing.
    * **`diskio`:** Reaching zero usage might indicate a system-wide issue or a misconfiguration preventing disk access.
    * **`cpu_usage`:** A significant decrease could be a symptom of a process not functioning correctly or being starved of resources.

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests a failure. The system is not operating as expected, leading to decreased performance and potential service disruptions.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the precise cause of the issues by examining the change log, system logs, and resource usage.
    2. **Rollback:** If possible, revert the change to restore the system to a known working state.
    3. **Mitigations:** If a rollback is not feasible, implement temporary solutions to address the most critical issues while working on a permanent fix.

	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Normal" because the KPI data shows no significant deviations or performance issues after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** N/A (Not Applicable) as there are no KPIs showing significant abnormal behavior.
* **Reason:** The analysis focuses on the KPIs, which are the primary indicators of system health. While the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies, the provided KPI data doesn't support a "failure" classification.  
* **Solution:** N/A (Not Applicable) as there are no identified failures to address.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs are within expected ranges and no anomalies were detected.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "None" because there are no KPIs that show significant deviations.
* **reason:** The analysis of the KPIs and the absence of anomaly detection signals suggest that the change did not negatively impact the system.
* **solution:** Not applicable since the change was classified as normal.
