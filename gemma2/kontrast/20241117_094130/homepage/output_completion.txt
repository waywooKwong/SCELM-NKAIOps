**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the metrics clearly show a negative impact.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `request_success_rate`:  A sharp drop in success rate indicates problems with the service handling requests.
    * `request_count`: A significant increase, even if not directly causing failure, can strain resources and potentially lead to further issues.
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these KPIs strongly suggests the change introduced bugs or performance problems.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on debugging and troubleshooting the change.
