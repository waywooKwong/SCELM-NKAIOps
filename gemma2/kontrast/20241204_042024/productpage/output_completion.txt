``` 


**Explanation:**

Based on the provided data, the change appears to be normal. Here's why:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** The KPIs (request_success_rate and request_count) show minimal changes before and after the change, remaining within historical ranges.
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm, designed to detect anomalies, did not flag any issues.
* **No New Log Patterns:** The mention of a "newly generated log pattern" is not directly linked to performance degradation or system instability.

Therefore, the change does not exhibit symptoms of a failure.

	"reason": "The metrics show a significant decrease in 'request_success_rate' and a shift in the 'request_count' trend after the change. This indicates potential issues with service availability and request processing. The 'SCWARN' algorithm also flagged anomalies, further supporting the classification of this change as a failure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the recent modifications to identify the root cause of the anomalies. \n2. **Analyze logs:** Examine system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data shifts. \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs:** Continuously track the performance of 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' to identify patterns or further deviations. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting service functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Test and debug:** Implement thorough testing and debugging procedures to identify and resolve the root cause of the anomalies."
