**Explanation:**

While the provided data mentions anomalies identified by the SCWARN algorithm, it doesn't specify which KPIs are affected or the nature of the anomalies.  The overall description states that KPIs like "request_count" and "request_success_rate" show no significant deviations.  

Therefore, based on the available information, the change appears to be **normal**.

**Explanation:**

While the `request_count` and `request_success_rate` KPIs did change after the deployment, the provided data doesn't conclusively demonstrate a failure.  Here's why:

* **No Threshold Exceedances:** The analysis states "Total anomalies found: -1" and "Total number of anomalous kpis: 0". This suggests no KPIs exceeded predefined thresholds for triggering an alert.
* **Context is Missing:** We need more information about the expected behavior of these KPIs. A shift in range could be normal depending on the service's usage patterns and the intended changes from the deployment.
* **"Recover to normal state" Anomalies:** The description mentions "Recover to normal state" anomaly types, implying the system might have experienced temporary fluctuations that resolved themselves.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Define Thresholds:** Establish clear thresholds for KPI variations that indicate a potential issue.
2. **Baseline Comparison:** Compare the post-change KPIs to a baseline established before the deployment to better understand the magnitude of the shifts.
3. **Impact Assessment:** Investigate whether the observed KPI changes have a noticeable impact on system performance, user experience, or other critical factors.
4. **Log Analysis:**  Examine the "newly generated log pattern" mentioned in the data. This could provide valuable insights into the root cause of any anomalies. 



Let me know if you have any more details about the service or the expected KPI behavior.
