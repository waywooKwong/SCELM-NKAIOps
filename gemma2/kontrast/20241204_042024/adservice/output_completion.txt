**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the overall trend of KPIs, despite some anomalies, suggests the change did not significantly disrupt the system. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because while anomalies exist, they don't point to a catastrophic failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that the anomalies detected are not severe enough to classify the change as a failure. The system's performance remains within acceptable bounds.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no issues requiring immediate action were identified.

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs, while showing some variation, remain within acceptable ranges and don't point to a system failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because no KPIs exhibit significant deviations that would classify the change as a failure.
* **reason:** The analysis focuses on the absence of substantial KPI deviations and the lack of evidence suggesting a system failure. The 'SCWARN algorithm' might flag anomalies, but the data itself doesn't support a failure classification.
* **solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change. istio_duration and istio_success_rate show drastic increases and decreases respectively, indicating potential issues with service communication. cpu_usage and memory_usage also show increased ranges, suggesting resource contention. net_send_packet shows a slight increase, which could be related to the other changes.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased resource consumption and communication issues. Review logs and system configurations around the time of the change. Consider scaling resources or optimizing code to improve performance and stability."
