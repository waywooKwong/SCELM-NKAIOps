	"reason": "The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies in the 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' KPIs.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies in key performance indicators. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "request_count, request_success_rate" are listed as the primary anomalies.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to the SCWARN algorithm's detection of anomalies, indicating potential issues with the change's impact on request handling and success rates.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a deeper investigation into the specific timestamps flagged by SCWARN to identify the root cause of the anomalies and implement a fix.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the provided data doesn't show a clear pattern of failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A"  Since the change type is "normal", there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The analysis points out anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm, but the KPIs themselves don't show significant deviations. The data ranges remain consistent before and after the change.
* **Solution:** "N/A"  No solution is needed as the change is not classified as a failure.

	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant deviation in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.  The 'request_success_rate' dropped to 0 after the change, indicating a complete failure in processing requests.  The 'request_count' also showed a shift in its range and trend, suggesting a disruption in request handling.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact. \n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Carefully examine the modifications made before the data shift, looking for potential bugs, misconfigurations, or unintended side effects. \n3. **Analyze system logs:** Investigate logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI deviations. \n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the anomalous KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations. \n5. **Engage with relevant stakeholders:** Collaborate with developers, system administrators, and other relevant parties to diagnose the root cause and implement a solution."
