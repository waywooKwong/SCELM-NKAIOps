}
``` 


**Explanation:**

While the data mentions anomalies detected by the SCWARN algorithm and changes in KPI ranges, the overall trend analysis suggests that these changes are not severe enough to classify the change as a failure. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **KPI Ranges:**  While some KPIs have wider ranges after the change, they are still within acceptable bounds. The "whole trend" descriptions indicate both upward and downward trends, suggesting a dynamic system rather than a clear degradation.
* **Anomaly Types:** The described anomaly types (Level shift up, Single spike, etc.) are not necessarily indicative of a major failure. They could represent temporary fluctuations or adjustments within normal system behavior.

* **Lack of Severe Impact:** The provided data doesn't highlight any catastrophic system failures, significant error rate increases, or major downtime.


Therefore, based on the available information, the change appears to be **normal**. Continued monitoring is always recommended to ensure the system remains stable and performs as expected.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "While the SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, the provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations in system performance. The anomalies detected don't correspond to a breach of established thresholds.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs, despite anomalies detected, remain within acceptable ranges and no significant performance degradation is observed.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because the anomalies don't represent a failure scenario based on the provided data.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights that the anomalies detected don't translate to a failure based on the data.
* **solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified requiring a solution.
