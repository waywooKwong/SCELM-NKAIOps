{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "While there were anomalies detected, the provided data indicates that KPIs like `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `diskio`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration` remained within historical norms after the change.  The overall trend of the data suggests the change did not significantly impact system performance.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" -  The analysis shows no significant KPI deviations or anomalies, suggesting the change did not negatively impact the system. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" -  Since the change type is "normal," there are no abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The data indicates that although anomalies were detected, the KPIs remained within acceptable ranges. The overall trend suggests the change did not significantly impact system performance. 
* **Solution:** "N/A" - No solution is required as the change did not cause any issues.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.

	"solution": "Investigate the code changes implemented during the deployment to identify the root cause of the increased resource consumption and communication overhead. Consider optimizing the code, adjusting resource allocation, or scaling infrastructure to address the performance issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change, particularly the significant increases in resource usage and service mesh metrics.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The most impactful KPIs showing abnormal behavior are:
    * `net_send_packet`:  Decreased steadily, which could indicate reduced network activity or potential issues with data transmission.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `istio_count`: Increased, suggesting potential issues with service mesh communication.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, indicating longer service mesh call durations.

* **Reason:** The increased resource consumption and network activity point to a potential performance bottleneck introduced by the change. The decrease in `net_send_packet` suggests a possible disconnect or issue in data flow.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on debugging the code changes and optimizing resource utilization.  It also suggests investigating the potential issues with the service mesh (Istio) to ensure proper communication and efficient call durations.

**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that the KPIs (net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage, diskio, istio_count, istio_duration) show changes but not significant deviations that would classify the change as a failure. 

* **No Exceeding Thresholds:** The data states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal."
* **Within Historical Norms:**  The analysis mentions KPIs "remain within historical norms."

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the substantial and negative changes in several critical KPIs.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The analysis highlights CPU usage, disk I/O, istio_duration, memory usage, and net_recv_packet as the primary indicators of failure.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a significant drop in CPU and disk I/O, suggesting potential resource starvation or misconfiguration. The increased istio_duration points to problems within the service mesh, potentially causing latency issues. Memory usage changes and the shift in net_recv_packet also contribute to the overall picture of system instability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the specific reasons behind the decreased CPU and disk I/O.
    2. **Service Mesh Investigation:** Analyze the increased istio_duration to pinpoint bottlenecks and performance issues within the service mesh.
    3. **Resource Optimization:** Review memory usage patterns and adjust resource allocation to ensure efficient utilization.
    4. **Network Performance Assessment:** Investigate the changes in net_recv_packet to rule out network configuration problems or traffic fluctuations.
    5. **Rollback or Mitigation:** Consider rolling back the change if the issues are directly attributable to it. Otherwise, implement mitigating measures to restore system stability and performance.
