**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no significant deviations or anomalies.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "None" because there are no KPIs that exceed thresholds or show significant deviations.
* **Reason:** The analysis of the provided data shows that all KPIs remain within acceptable ranges, and the SCWARN algorithm did not detect any anomalies.
* **Solution:**  Not applicable as the change is classified as "normal".

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most drastic changes are:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A sharp decrease indicates potential problems with service requests being successfully completed.
    * `diskio`: Increased volatility suggests potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased usage could mean the service is struggling to keep up with demand.
    * `istio_count`: A significant increase might indicate an issue with request handling or routing within the Istio service mesh.
    * `net_recv_packet`:  A change in network reception patterns could point to issues with data transfer or network configuration.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a systemic issue within the `recommendationservice` after the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a thorough investigation to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem and implement appropriate corrective actions.
