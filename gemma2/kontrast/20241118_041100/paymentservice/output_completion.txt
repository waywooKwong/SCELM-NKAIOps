{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that there are no significant deviations in KPIs after the change.  While there were anomalies detected, they were single spikes in CPU usage that recovered to normal.  Other KPIs like net_send_packet, diskio, istio_success_rate, memory_usage, istio_count, and istio_duration show no significant changes or deviations from expected ranges.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Normal" because the KPIs remain within historical norms and there's no indication of system degradation.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** N/A because there were no significant or persistent KPI abnormalities. 
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that the anomalies detected were single spikes in CPU usage that quickly resolved. Other KPIs show no significant changes, indicating the change did not negatively impact system performance.
* **Solution:** N/A as no failures were identified.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The  significant changes in KPIs like `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `istio_count`, `istio_duration`, and `cpu_usage` point to a failure. These are not typical fluctuations and indicate a problem.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The listed KPIs show the most drastic changes after the change was implemented.

* **Reason:** The  abnormal spikes and shifts in these KPIs clearly demonstrate that the change introduced problems.  

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the source of the problem:
    * **Code Review:** Look for errors or unintended consequences in the recent code changes.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine logs for error messages or unusual events that might correlate with the anomalies.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous stable state.
    * **Fix Implementation:** If a rollback is not feasible, develop and implement a fix to address the root cause of the performance degradation.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior, suggesting the change introduced issues.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs demonstrate the most significant changes:
    * **`net_send_packet`:**  Large negative values indicate potential network communication errors or dropped packets.
    * **`diskio`:**  While the range is small, the shift to positive values suggests increased disk activity, which could be a sign of performance strain.
    * **`memory_usage`:**  Negative values indicate potential memory allocation issues or leaks.
    * **`istio_count`:**  Increased values suggest potential issues within the Istio service mesh, possibly related to increased requests or errors.
    * **`istio_duration`:**  Large values indicate slowdowns within the Istio service mesh, affecting request processing times. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a failure in the change. The issues likely stem from the code changes themselves, leading to problems in network communication, resource utilization (memory, disk), and the Istio service mesh.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach:
    * **Code Review:** Carefully examine the changes made to identify potential errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Analyze system logs around the time of the anomalies to pinpoint specific events or error messages related to the affected KPIs.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continue monitoring the system closely to track the impact of any changes made and ensure stability.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type**:  We classify this as "normal" because the KPIs remain within historical norms and there's no evidence of a failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  Since this is a normal change, we don't list any abnormal KPIs.
* **reason**: The analysis highlights that while anomalies were detected, they were transient and didn't lead to sustained performance issues. The KPIs didn't show significant deviations from expected behavior.
* **solution**:  Because this is not a failure, no specific solution is required.
