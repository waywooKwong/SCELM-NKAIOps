**Explanation:**

The analysis states that all KPIs  remain within historical norms. There are no significant deviations or anomalies reported.  Therefore, the change is classified as "normal". Since there are no abnormal KPIs, the "Top 5 abnormal kpi" field is marked as "N/A", and the "solution" field is also marked as "N/A" as no issues need addressing.

	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations in system performance.

	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs didn't show significant deviations or disruptions after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  "N/A" because there were no persistent abnormal KPIs.
* **Reason:** The analysis points out that the anomalies detected were transient and recovered to normal. This, combined with the stable KPIs, suggests the change didn't cause lasting negative effects.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified, so no solutions are needed.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs haven't shown significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A"  since there are no KPIs that are primarily responsible for a failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis of the KPIs,  including the "istio_duration", "istio_success_rate", "cpu_usage", "memory_usage", "net_send_packet", and "net_recv_packet",  shows no major upward or downward trends that would indicate a failure.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no failures were identified.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  istio_duration and istio_success_rate show increased duration and decreased success rates, indicating potential issues with service performance.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five most impactful KPIs are:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration suggests the service is taking longer to respond.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased success rate indicates a higher failure rate for requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased CPU usage points to resource strain.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory usage further suggests resource limitations.
    * `net_send_packet`:  While seemingly less severe, this indicates potential network issues related to the service.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced problems with service performance, resource utilization, and potentially network connectivity.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to identify the root cause:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the code changes made during the period of the anomaly.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that coincide with the anomalies.
    * **Monitoring Data:** Analyze detailed monitoring data to pinpoint the exact timeframes and magnitudes of the deviations.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous state.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement solutions to address resource contention (e.g., scaling, optimization), network issues, or the specific problems identified in the code review and log analysis.
