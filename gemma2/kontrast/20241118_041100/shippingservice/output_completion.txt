	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped to 0, indicating potential communication failures. 'diskio', 'memory_usage', and 'net_send_packet'  show increased volatility and potentially resource contention. 'istio_duration'  experienced a significant increase, suggesting latency issues.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs listed are those that show the most significant and concerning changes after the change.
* **Reason:** The reason statement directly connects the observed KPI changes to the potential causes mentioned in the input data.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting the identified issues and potentially reverting the change if it's confirmed as the culprit.

The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, but these were single spikes or dips that recovered to normal state, indicating temporary fluctuations rather than persistent issues.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there's no evidence of system disruption.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no KPIs that show significant abnormal deviations.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that while anomalies were detected, they were temporary and recovered to normal. This suggests the change did not cause lasting negative impacts on system performance.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no issues were identified requiring a solution.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, diskio, memory_usage, net_send_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, 'diskio', 'memory_usage', and 'net_send_packet' showed altered ranges, and 'istio_duration' increased significantly.

	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in these KPIs. Review the implemented changes and identify any potential conflicts or misconfigurations.  Consider rolling back the change or implementing corrective measures to restore the KPIs to their normal ranges."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show a clear and significant deviation from their historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs represent the most impactful changes:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic decrease suggests issues with service communication and reliability.
    * `diskio`, `memory_usage`: Altered ranges indicate potential resource contention or inefficient resource utilization.
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased range suggests potential network congestion or issues with data transmission.
    * `istio_duration`: A significant increase points to delays in service requests, impacting user experience.
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the KPIs' significant deviations point to a disruption in service performance and stability.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the specific cause of the KPI changes.
    * **Change Review:** Examine the implemented changes for potential conflicts or misconfigurations.
    * **Rollback/Corrective Measures:** Consider reverting the change or implementing fixes to restore normal KPI values.

``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis provided states that the SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, but the data itself shows no KPI exceeding thresholds.  

* **No Threshold Exceedance:** The description emphasizes that "indicator data which exceed the threshold, which is considered abnormal." Since the data doesn't mention any KPIs exceeding thresholds, it's classified as "normal."
* **No Significant Deviations:** The analysis mentions "no significant degradation in system performance" and "KPIs remain within historical norms." This reinforces the "normal" classification.

``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No Threshold Exceedances:** The description explicitly states that indicator data exceeding the threshold is considered abnormal.  The analysis doesn't mention any KPIs exceeding their thresholds.
* **Stable Metrics:** The KPI descriptions show that while there are changes in values, they generally fall within the expected ranges. There are no sudden spikes, drops, or persistent shifts that would indicate a failure.
* **Absence of Failure Indicators:** The analysis doesn't point to any KPIs that are significantly responsible for a system degradation or failure.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis states that the KPIs  "remain within historical norms" and there's "no significant degradation in system performance." This directly aligns with the criteria for a "Normal Change." 

Since there are no abnormal KPIs, the "Top 5 abnormal kpi" field is marked as "N/A."  The "solution" field is also marked as "N/A" because no issues were identified.
