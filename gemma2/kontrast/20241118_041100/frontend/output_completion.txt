{
	"change_type": "failure",

	"reason": "There are significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'istio_success_rate'  dropped sharply, 'istio_duration'  showed a large increase in range, 'memory_usage'  decreased, and 'net_recv_packet' and 'istio_count'  experienced shifts in their ranges.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the substantial negative impact on KPIs like `istio_success_rate` and `istio_duration`, suggesting problems with service communication. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen because they show the most drastic changes after the change, indicating a direct impact on service performance.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the significant drops in `istio_success_rate` and the increase in `istio_duration`, pointing to potential issues with service communication. The changes in `memory_usage`, `net_recv_packet`, and `istio_count` further suggest a broader impact on system resources and performance.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the changes made during this period and monitoring system logs and metrics to pinpoint the source of the problem.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the provided KPI data clearly shows a significant negative impact on system performance after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **istio_success_rate:** A drastic drop indicates problems with communication and service reliability within the Istio service mesh.
    * **istio_duration:** A significant increase suggests delays in service requests, potentially causing slowdowns and impacting user experience.
    * **cpu_usage:** An increase could indicate resource contention or inefficient code execution, leading to performance degradation.
    * **net_send_packet:** An unusual trend might point to issues with network communication or data transmission.
    * **memory_usage:**  An increase could signal memory leaks or inefficient memory management, potentially causing system instability.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI deviations strongly suggests that the change introduced problems into the system. 

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identifying the exact change that caused the issues.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, reverting the change to restore previous functionality.
    * **Mitigations:** Implementing fixes to address the performance problems and stabilize the system.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Examining the "newly generated log pattern" for clues about the failure.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **istio_success_rate:**  A significant decrease indicates problems with successful communication between services.
    * **istio_duration:** A large increase suggests delays or inefficiencies in service interactions.
    * **net_recv_packet:**  A downward trend could mean reduced incoming network traffic, which might be unusual.
    * **net_send_packet:**  A downward trend could indicate reduced outgoing network traffic.
    * **memory_usage:**  While the trend is upward,  it's important to monitor if memory consumption is exceeding expected limits. 

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced problems with the service's communication, resource management, or both.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issues through investigation and potentially reverting the change or implementing fixes to restore normal performance.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic decrease in success rate indicates problems with communication or service requests.
    * `istio_duration`:  A wide range of increased durations suggests issues with service latency and processing time.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Unusual fluctuations in received packets indicate potential network connectivity problems.
    * `net_send_packet`: Similar to `net_recv_packet`, changes in sent packets point to network issues or service communication problems.
    * `istio_count`: Changes in the count of Istio requests could signal problems with service discovery or routing.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a failure related to communication, service reliability, and potentially network issues.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review, log analysis, and potentially rolling back the change.
