**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "normal" because the KPIs didn't show significant deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there were no KPIs that showed significant abnormal increases or decreases.
* **reason:** The analysis highlights that the KPIs remained within expected ranges and the identified anomalies were transient and didn't indicate a persistent failure.
* **solution:** "N/A" because there was no failure to address.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the KPIs did not show significant deviations after the change, and the anomalies detected were transient.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there were no persistent abnormal KPIs.
* **Reason:** The analysis of KPI changes shows that the system's performance remained stable after the change. The anomalies detected by SCWARN were temporary and did not indicate a lasting negative impact on the system.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no failure was identified.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The decrease in memory usage and CPU usage, coupled with the increase in istio duration, strongly suggest a negative impact on the service's performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  We prioritize the most impactful KPIs:
    * **memory_usage:**  A significant decrease indicates potential resource starvation.
    * **cpu_usage:**  A decrease suggests the service is not utilizing its allocated resources effectively.
    * **istio_duration:**  An increase points to communication delays between services, hindering overall performance.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests resource contention issues are causing performance degradation. 
* **Solution:** 
    * **Resource Contention:** Investigate if the service requires more resources (memory, CPU) or if there's a bottleneck in resource allocation.
    * **Istio Performance:** Analyze the code changes related to the service and identify potential performance bottlenecks in the communication layer (Istio). Consider optimizing service communication patterns or adjusting Istio configurations.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant changes in KPIs like CPU usage, disk I/O, istio_duration, and memory usage point towards a negative impact on the service's performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list includes KPIs that show the most drastic changes:
    * **cpu_usage:**  A sharp decrease suggests the service might not be utilizing its resources effectively or there could be a problem with its workload.
    * **diskio:**  Near-zero disk I/O indicates a potential issue with data access or processing.
    * **istio_duration:** A significant increase in this metric suggests problems within the service mesh, potentially causing delays in communication.
    * **memory_usage:** While the trend changed, the overall impact needs to be assessed.
    * **net_recv_packet:** A slight increase might be a consequence of the other changes.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the discrepancies between pre-change and post-change KPIs, indicating a failure.
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions address the specific issues identified: investigating resource utilization, network bottlenecks, and potential memory management problems.
