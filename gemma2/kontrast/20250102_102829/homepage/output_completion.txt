``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure:

* **request_success_rate plummeted to 0.0**:  This means no requests are being successfully processed after the change, signaling a major problem.
* **request_count shifted significantly**: While the count itself might not be the primary issue, the sudden change suggests something disrupted how requests are handled.
* **SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies**: This automated system is designed to detect deviations from normal behavior, further reinforcing the failure indication.

"
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The significant drop in `request_success_rate` to 0.0 and the multiple dips in `request_count` strongly suggest a failure in the system's ability to process requests.  
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We list `request_count` and `request_success_rate` as the primary KPIs impacted by the change.
* **reason**: The reason clearly states that the drop in `request_success_rate` and dips in `request_count` indicate a severe disruption in request processing. 
* **solution**: The suggested solutions include rolling back changes, reviewing code modifications, analyzing logs, and closely monitoring key metrics to identify and resolve the issue.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The drastic shift in KPIs 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' strongly indicates a failure. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  We focus on the two most significantly affected KPIs.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a change in trends and ranges for these KPIs, suggesting a problem introduced by the change.
* **Solution:** The solution focuses on:
    * Identifying the code changes made around the time of the anomaly.
    * Examining system logs for clues about errors or unusual activity during the anomalous periods.
    * Understanding the SCWARN algorithm's findings to pinpoint specific patterns in the data.
    * Checking system resource usage to rule out any resource contention issues.

Let me break down why I've classified this as a failure:

* **Decreased `request_success_rate`:** This is a major red flag. A lower success rate means users are likely encountering errors when trying to access the homepage, directly impacting user experience. 
* **Shifted `request_count` range:** While an increase in requests could be positive, a sudden shift in the range suggests the system might be struggling to handle the load or that some requests are being rejected. This needs further investigation.


The provided data strongly points towards a failure.  It's crucial to investigate these anomalies immediately to minimize disruption and restore normal service functionality.

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.  The 'request_success_rate' KPI dropped to 0 after the change, indicating a complete failure in processing requests.

"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**:  The KPIs show a drastic change, with `request_success_rate` dropping to 0, indicating a complete failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: The most significant anomalies are in `request_count` and `request_success_rate`.
* **reason**: The data clearly points to a failure caused by the change.
* **solution**: The suggested steps include rolling back changes, reviewing code, analyzing logs, and monitoring performance closely.
