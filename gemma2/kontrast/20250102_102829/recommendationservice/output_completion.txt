**Explanation:**

* **change_type:** "failure" because the KPI data clearly shows a negative trend after the change. This indicates something went wrong.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The selection prioritizes KPIs showing the most significant increases and those directly related to performance (duration, request counts, CPU usage).
* **reason:** A concise explanation linking the abnormal KPIs to potential problems like bottlenecks or increased load.
* **solution:**  A suggested course of action that focuses on:
    * Identifying the root cause through logs and monitoring.
    * Focusing on 'istio' and network-related data as they seem most affected.
    * Exploring resource optimization, configuration adjustments, or scaling as potential remedies.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_duration",
	"reason": "There are significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. cpu_usage shows a decrease, istio_count and net_send_packet exhibit downward trends, while net_recv_packet also declines.  This suggests a potential negative impact on system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these KPI changes. Analyze logs, monitor resource usage, and review recent configuration updates to pinpoint the source of the issue. Consider reverting the change if it appears to be causing adverse effects."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **`change_type: "failure"`:** The observed KPI changes indicate a potential problem, hence classifying this as a failure.
* **`Top 5 abnormal kpi`:**  We list the KPIs that show the most significant deviations from their expected behavior. 
* **`reason:`** A clear explanation is provided, outlining the nature of the KPI changes and their potential implications for system performance.
* **`solution:`** This section offers actionable steps to address the identified issue: investigation, analysis, and potential reversion of the change.

	"reason": "A significant deviation in key metrics like cpu_usage,  istio_count, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, and istio_duration indicates a potential performance issue or system strain. The decrease in cpu_usage and increase in others suggest resource contention or increased load.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased load on the system. Analyze logs, monitor resource usage, and identify any bottlenecks or inefficient processes. Consider scaling resources, optimizing application code, or adjusting configuration settings to alleviate the strain."
