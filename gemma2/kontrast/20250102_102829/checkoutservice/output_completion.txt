Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Thresholds:** The provided information states that any indicator data exceeding a specific threshold is considered abnormal.  Since you haven't given me those thresholds, I can't definitively say if any KPIs are out of bounds.
* **Normal Operation:**  The text says the set of data has been tested and *all* indicator data does not exceed the threshold. This strongly suggests normal operation.



Let me know if you have the specific thresholds for these KPIs, and I can give you a more precise analysis!

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The significant drops in `istio_success_rate` and `net_recv_packet`, coupled with the rise in `diskio`, strongly indicate a negative impact from the change.  
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These are the KPIs that show the most drastic changes, suggesting they are directly affected by the issue.
* **reason:** A concise explanation of the observed issues based on the KPI deviations.
* **solution:** A suggested course of action to diagnose and resolve the problem.
