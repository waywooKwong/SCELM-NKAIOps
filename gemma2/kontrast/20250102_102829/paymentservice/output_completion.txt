	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'net_io', 'diskio', 'istio_count', 'memory_usage', and 'cpu_usage' all exhibit increased negative values and wider ranges compared to pre-change measurements. This suggests a potential resource contention issue or inefficiency introduced by the change.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate Resource Utilization:** Analyze system logs and monitoring data to pinpoint which processes or services are consuming excessive resources after the change. 2. **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Adjust resource allocation policies (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to ensure sufficient resources are available for critical components. 3. **Review Code Changes:** Carefully examine the code changes implemented to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms that might be contributing to the performance degradation. 4. **Stress Testing:** Conduct thorough stress testing to simulate high-load scenarios and identify performance limitations introduced by the change."

``` 


**Explanation of Reasoning:**

* **Significant Deviations:** The post-change values for 'net_io', 'diskio', 'istio_count', 'memory_usage', and 'cpu_usage' are  significantly different from their pre-change counterparts. This indicates a substantial impact on system performance.
* **Negative Values:**  The presence of negative values in these KPIs is unusual and warrants investigation. It could suggest resource oversubscription or unexpected behavior in the system.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Left as "None" since there are no KPIs flagged as problematic.
* **reason:** A clear statement explaining that the KPI values are within acceptable ranges, suggesting normal operation.
* **solution:** Since there's no issue, no solution is needed at this time.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration, istio_success_rate, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The system experienced a significant increase in memory usage, istio request count and duration after the change.  Additionally, there was a decrease in istio success rate and an overall spike in CPU usage. These anomalies suggest a potential performance bottleneck or resource contention issue caused by the implemented change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made to identify the source of the increased memory consumption, istio request volume and duration. Optimize database queries, application logic, and network configurations to alleviate resource pressure. Consider scaling up infrastructure resources if necessary."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, istio_duration, memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_success_rate",
	"reason": "Multiple KPIs exhibit significant deviations from normal patterns.  'istio_count', 'istio_duration', and 'memory_usage' show substantial increases while 'cpu_usage' and 'istio_success_rate' experience unusual drops. This suggests potential issues with service communication, resource consumption, or performance bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "1. Investigate the cause of the increased 'istio_count' and 'istio_duration'.  This could indicate heavy traffic, latency issues, or misconfigurations within the Istio mesh. 2. Analyze memory and CPU usage spikes. Identify resource-intensive processes or applications contributing to the elevated 'memory_usage' and 'cpu_usage'. Consider scaling resources or optimizing application code. 3. Examine logs and metrics related to the 'istio_success_rate' drop.  Troubleshoot any errors or failures occurring during service communication."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_io, diskio, istio_duration, cpu_usage, memory_usage",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  Metrics like `net_io`, `diskio`, `istio_duration`, `cpu_usage`, and `memory_usage` show increased volatility and deviations from previous trends. This suggests a potential issue with the implemented changes that requires further investigation.",
	"solution": "1. **Review Recent Changes:** Analyze the code changes made around the time of the data anomaly to identify potential culprits. 2. **Resource Monitoring:**  Closely monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during periods of high traffic or after the change to pinpoint bottlenecks. 3. **Log Analysis:** Examine logs for error messages or unusual activity patterns that might correlate with the KPI deviations. 4. **Rollback and Testing:** If possible, revert the recent changes and test again to isolate the source of the problem. 5. **Performance Tuning:** Optimize the code and system configuration based on the identified issues to improve performance and stability."
