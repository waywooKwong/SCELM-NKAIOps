	"reason": "The change resulted in anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. The 'request_success_rate'  showed a downward trend after the change, indicating potential issues with service availability or request processing.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The observed changes in `request_success_rate` and `request_count` indicate a negative impact on the system's performance. These are significant deviations from the expected behavior, suggesting a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  We list `request_success_rate` and `request_count` as the primary abnormal KPIs due to their noticeable shifts after the change.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a decline in `request_success_rate`, meaning requests are not being processed successfully as before.  Simultaneously,  `request_count` increases, indicating more requests are being made despite the lower success rate. This combination suggests potential issues with service capacity or request handling logic introduced by the change.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution outlines a structured approach to troubleshooting the issue:

    1. **Code Review:** Examine recent code changes for potential bugs or unintended consequences.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity patterns that coincide with the data anomalies.
    3. **Continuous Monitoring:**  Keep a close eye on the performance of `request_success_rate` and `request_count` to observe trends and identify recurring problems.
    4. **Rollback:** If the situation is critical, consider reverting to the previous version of the software to restore stable operation.
    5. **Testing & Debugging:**  Perform thorough testing and debugging exercises to pinpoint the exact cause of the anomalies and implement a fix.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the 'request_success_rate' KPI indicates a decline in service performance after the change, suggesting the change negatively impacted the system.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The primary abnormal KPI is 'request_success_rate'.  While other KPIs might be affected, this one directly reflects the core functionality of the service.
* **Reason:** The downward trend in 'request_success_rate' coupled with anomaly detection flags points to a failure. This suggests the change introduced bugs or altered behavior leading to unsuccessful requests.
* **Solution:** A thorough investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause (e.g., faulty code logic, configuration errors). Once identified, fixes should be implemented and rigorous testing performed to ensure the issue is resolved.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in 'request_success_rate' and a shift in the trend of 'request_count'.  The SCWARN algorithm also flagged anomalies, indicating the change deviated from expected behavior patterns. This suggests a problem with the implemented changes affecting the service's ability to process requests successfully.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact. \n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Carefully examine the modifications made, focusing on areas related to request handling and success rate calculation. \n3. **Analyze logs and system events:** Investigate logs and system events around the time of the change to identify potential error messages, warnings, or unusual activity. \n4. **Monitor KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the affected KPIs to identify any recurring issues or further deviations. \n5. **Engage with developers and experts:** Collaborate with developers and system experts to diagnose the root cause of the anomalies and implement a permanent solution."
