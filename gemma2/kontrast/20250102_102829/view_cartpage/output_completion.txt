{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant drop in the 'request_success_rate' KPI, indicating a failure to process requests successfully.  This is further supported by the SCWARN algorithm identifying anomalies at specific timestamps, suggesting a pattern of disruption.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: failure:** The 'request_success_rate' dropping to 0% strongly suggests a failure in processing requests.  

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi: request_success_rate:** This KPI directly reflects the success of handling requests, and its significant decrease is the primary indicator of failure.
   
* **reason:** The combination of the 'request_success_rate' drop and the SCWARN algorithm's identification of anomalies points to a problem introduced by the recent changes.

* **solution:** The suggested solutions focus on:
    * **Reverting changes:**  The first step is always to undo any potentially problematic code modifications.
    * **Code review:** Carefully examining the code for errors or unintended consequences related to request handling.
    * **Log analysis:** Identifying specific events in the logs that might correlate with the failure. 
    * **Performance monitoring:** Checking if the system was under heavy load or experiencing performance issues during the change window.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type**:  The provided data indicates no major deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) like 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'. The slight variations are within acceptable ranges and don't point to a significant system degradation.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: N/A - As no KPIs show substantial anomalies, this field is left blank.
* **Reason**:  The analysis of pre- and post-change KPI data reveals that the changes did not cause any notable disruptions in system performance. The KPIs remain stable and within expected norms.

* **Solution**: Since the change appears to be normal, no immediate solution is required. Continued monitoring of these KPIs is recommended to ensure ongoing stability.

	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations from expected behavior in key performance indicators.  'request_count' shows an unusual upward trend after the change, while 'request_success_rate' remains consistently at 0, indicating a complete failure in processing requests. This suggests a critical issue with the implemented changes.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact. \n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Carefully examine the modifications made before the data shift, looking for potential bugs, misconfigurations, or unintended side effects. \n3. **Analyze system logs:** Investigate logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI deviations. \n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' to identify patterns or further deviations. \n5. **Engage with relevant stakeholders:** Collaborate with developers, operations teams, and other involved parties to diagnose the root cause of the issue and implement a permanent fix."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

*   **change_type: "failure"**: The change demonstrably caused negative effects on the system's performance.  The data clearly shows abnormal trends in 'request_count' and a complete failure in 'request_success_rate'.

*   **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: While only two KPIs are directly mentioned as problematic, this field is left open for future analysis if more indicators reveal issues.
*   **reason**: The provided information about the data trends clearly points to a failed change.
*   **solution**:  The recommended steps cover common procedures for addressing such issues: rollback, code review, log analysis, monitoring, and collaboration with relevant teams.
