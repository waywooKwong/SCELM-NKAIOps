Let me break down why the output is formatted this way:

* **`change_type`: "normal"`**  Since the provided data indicates that no indicators exceeded their thresholds, we classify this as a "normal" change.

* **`"Top 5 abnormal kpi": null`** Because there were no abnormal KPIs identified, this field remains empty (null).

* **`"reason"`:** This field explains our classification based on the data: all indicator values stayed within acceptable limits.

* **`"solution"`:** Since we've determined the change is normal, a solution isn't necessary.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the described KPI changes strongly suggest a negative impact.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The most concerning KPIs are listed. 
* **reason:** A clear explanation is provided, linking the KPI changes to potential problems like performance degradation or resource overuse.
* **solution:**  Actionable steps are suggested: investigate the code change, monitor resources, and consider a rollback if necessary.

	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, memory_usage, net_send_packet, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "A significant drop in istio_success_rate and istio_duration indicates issues with communication between services.  Memory usage also decreased after the change, which could point to resource leaks or inefficient code. While CPU usage remained relatively stable, there was a noticeable change in network packet sending. These combined anomalies suggest a failure.",
	"solution": "Investigate potential issues with the deployed code or configuration changes that might be causing communication failures and memory management problems. Review logs for error messages related to Istio and network traffic. Consider reverting recent changes or implementing rollbacks to isolate the problematic update."

	"reason": "Multiple KPIs indicate a significant performance degradation. istio_success_rate shows a drastic decrease,  istio_duration increased substantially, and net_send_packet, memory_usage, and cpu_usage show deviations from their normal ranges.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these performance issues. This could involve reviewing logs, monitoring system resources, and analyzing network traffic. Consider scaling up resources or optimizing application code to improve efficiency."
