	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_duration' and 'request_count'. The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change.  'request_duration' now shows a much wider range, with values exceeding 16 seconds, while 'request_count' has decreased significantly.",

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The significant shift in 'request_duration' (exceeding 16 seconds) and a substantial decrease in 'request_count' strongly indicate a failure. These changes suggest a problem with the system's ability to handle requests efficiently.

* **Suggested Actions:**
    * Reviewing recent code changes is crucial to identify any bugs or misconfigurations introduced during the last update.
    * Comparing logs before and after the change can reveal error messages or unusual events that might shed light on the issue.
    * Investigating the SCWARN algorithm alerts provides valuable insights into the specific timeframes when anomalies occurred. Analyzing the data patterns during these periods is essential for pinpointing the root cause.
    * Monitoring system resources helps determine if resource constraints (CPU, memory, disk) are contributing to the performance degradation.

}
``` 



**Explanation:**

Based on the data provided, the change appears to be normal. Here's why:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:**  The KPIs `request_duration` and `request_count` show changes in their ranges after the modification, but these changes don't necessarily indicate a failure. The ranges are still within plausible values. 
* **SCWARN Algorithm Unaffected:** The fact that the SCWARN algorithm did not flag any anomalies suggests that the change did not introduce unexpected behavior patterns.
* **Missing Information:** While the data points to a normal change, more context would be helpful for a more definitive assessment. For example:

    *  **Baseline KPIs:** Comparing the post-change KPIs to historical baselines (before any changes) would provide a clearer picture of the impact.
    * **Expected Behavior:** Understanding the intended outcomes of the change would allow for better evaluation of whether the observed KPI shifts align with expectations.

**Explanation:**

The provided data shows a clear deviation in the "request_duration" and "request_count" KPIs after the change.  

* **Increased request_duration:** This suggests that requests are taking longer to process, which could be due to inefficient code, resource contention, or database issues.
* **Decreased request_count:** This indicates a lower volume of requests being handled, which might be related to the increased duration as users become frustrated and abandon their interactions.

These anomalies strongly point towards a "failure" in the implementation.

}
``` 



**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear failure.  Here's why:

* **Significant Data Range Shifts:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show dramatic changes in their minimum, maximum, and overall ranges after the change. This suggests a fundamental alteration in how the system is behaving.
* **Trend Changes:** The shift from a downward trend to an upward trend for `request_duration` is particularly concerning. It implies that something is causing requests to take longer to process.

**Actions:**

The suggested solutions aim to pinpoint the root cause of this failure:

1. **Code Review:** Look for any recent changes in the codebase that could directly or indirectly impact request processing times and counts.
2. **Log Analysis:** System logs can provide valuable clues about errors, warnings, or unusual events that occurred around the time of the change.
3. **Incident Investigation:**  The mentioned incident involving a white list deletion might be directly responsible for the performance issues. Thoroughly investigate its impact on system configurations and operations.
4. **Resource Monitoring:** Resource bottlenecks can lead to performance degradation. Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O to identify any areas where the system is struggling.

}
``` 


Let me explain the reasoning behind this classification:

* **Drastic Data Range Shifts:** The provided data shows significant changes in both 'request_duration' (maximum value now over 26 seconds) and 'request_count' (decreased significantly). These shifts are not typical fluctuations and strongly suggest something is wrong.
* **Incident Correlation:**  The mention of a "Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" incident further supports the failure classification. Configuration errors can directly lead to performance issues like those observed.
