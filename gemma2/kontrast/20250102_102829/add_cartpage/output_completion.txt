The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

*   **change_type: "failure"**:  The significant shifts in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate', combined with the SCWARN alerts, strongly suggest a failure.
*   **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: "request_count", "request_success_rate" - These are the primary KPIs impacted by the change.
*   **reason:** The reason for the classification is clearly stated, emphasizing the drastic changes in key performance indicators and pointing to potential issues with code, configuration, or system resources.
*   **solution**:  A structured approach is outlined:

    1. **Code review:** Identify potential errors introduced by recent code changes.
    2. **Log analysis:** Scrutinize logs for clues about the cause of the anomalies.
    3. **SCWARN investigation:** Focus on the specific timestamps flagged by the algorithm to pinpoint events or patterns contributing to the failure.
    4. **Resource monitoring:** Check if system resources were overloaded during the anomaly period, which could explain the performance issues.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Normal** -  The metrics haven't crossed pre-defined thresholds or exhibited patterns clearly indicative of a failure. The absence of anomalies and the lack of significant performance degradation suggest the change likely went smoothly.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** N/A - Since there are no identified KPIs exceeding thresholds, this field is left blank.

* **Reason:**  The provided data shows changes in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' after the change, but these changes don't necessarily point to a failure. The ranges might have shifted due to various factors unrelated to a bug or issue introduced by the change. 

* **Solution:** N/A - Since the change is classified as "normal", no immediate solution is required. Continued monitoring of these metrics and a deeper analysis with historical data can provide further insights into the normal fluctuation range of these KPIs.

    * **Log Analysis:** Examine system logs to pinpoint any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity occurring around the time of the data anomalies.
    * **Incident Investigation:** The "Deleting White List" incident needs to be thoroughly investigated to determine its connection to the observed performance issues.

	"solution": ""
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

Based on the provided data, the change appears to be **normal**. Here's why:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:**  The metrics for `request_count` and `request_success_rate` show changes in trend but remain within acceptable ranges. There's no evidence of a sudden drop or spike that would indicate a failure.
* **SCWARN Algorithm:** The absence of anomalies flagged by the 'SCWARN' algorithm further supports the conclusion that the change did not introduce significant disruptions.
* **No New Log Patterns:** While the analysis mentions a "newly generated log pattern," this information is insufficient to classify the change as a failure without understanding the nature and impact of this new pattern. 

**Important Note:**  Without more detailed information about the expected behavior of the `add_cartpage` service, it's difficult to provide a more definitive assessment.

	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "normal" because the total number of anomalies detected is very low (-1), and no top 5 KPIs stand out as significantly abnormal.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  Not applicable as there aren't enough significant anomalies to list.
* **Reason:** The provided data shows some fluctuations in 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' after the change. However, a single negative anomaly value (-1) does not necessarily indicate a failure. More context and analysis are needed to understand the significance of these changes. 
* **Solution:**  Since the current data doesn't clearly point to a failure, further investigation is recommended:
    * **Monitor KPIs over a longer period:** Observe if the observed trends persist or revert to normal patterns.
    * **Analyze logs for specific error messages:** Look for any new error messages or patterns that might correlate with the change.
    * **Review system resource utilization:** Check if the change has significantly impacted CPU, memory, or network resources.

**Explanation:**

The data clearly indicates a failure. Here's why:

* **Significant KPI Shifts:** Both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` show substantial changes in their range and trend after the change. This suggests a disruption in the system's normal behavior.
* **Negative Impacts:** The increased `request_count` could indicate an overload situation, while the decreased `request_success_rate` points to problems with handling requests effectively, leading to failures.
* **SCWARN Alerts:**  The SCWARN algorithm pinpointing specific anomaly times strengthens the case for a failure. Investigating these periods will likely reveal the exact cause.

**The solution outlined in the JSON response focuses on:**

1. **Code Review:** Identifying potential coding errors introduced by the change.
2. **Log Analysis:** Finding clues about system behavior and errors during the anomalous periods.
3. **Resource Monitoring:** Checking if resource limitations are causing the issues.
