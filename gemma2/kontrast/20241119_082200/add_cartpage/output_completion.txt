	"solution": "1. **Review the recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the anomalous KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Conduct further investigation:** If the root cause remains unclear, engage in deeper analysis, potentially involving profiling tools or expert consultation."
