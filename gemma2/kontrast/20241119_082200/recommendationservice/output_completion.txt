**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The KPIs show clear negative impacts after the change, suggesting a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  We focus on the most impactful KPIs:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic decrease indicates problems with communication or routing within the system.
    * `diskio`: A decrease in disk I/O could signal inefficient data access or storage issues.
    * `cpu_usage`: A drop in CPU usage might seem positive, but if it's accompanied by other issues, it could indicate a slowdown or resource starvation elsewhere.
    * `istio_count`: A shift in the range suggests changes in traffic patterns or service interactions. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a problem with the software change's integration or functionality.  
* **Solution:**  The suggested steps involve a thorough analysis to pinpoint the exact cause and then implement a fix to restore normal system behavior.
