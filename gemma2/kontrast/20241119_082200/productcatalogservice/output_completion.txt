**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant upward trends in `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `istio_duration`, and `istio_count`, coupled with the increase in `net_send_packet`, strongly suggest a failure. These metrics indicate the system is under strain.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The listed KPIs are the most directly affected by the change and show the most concerning deviations.
* **Reason:** The increased resource usage points to a possible issue with the code changes. The `istio_duration` increase suggests potential latency issues within the service mesh. 
* **Solution:**  A thorough code review is crucial to pinpoint the cause of the increased resource consumption. Optimization strategies and potential scaling solutions should be explored.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because several KPIs show significant deviations from their pre-change behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_duration`: A large increase in maximum values and a downward trend indicate potential issues with service communication or latency.
    * `memory_usage`: Decreased minimum values and increased mean values suggest increased memory consumption, which could lead to performance degradation.
    * `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `cpu_usage`:  Changes in their ranges and trends point to potential network or processing bottlenecks.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPI changes strongly suggests that the changes made to the 'productcatalogservice' negatively impacted system performance.
* **Solution:**  A thorough investigation is needed to pinpoint the source of the problem. This might involve:
    * Reviewing the change logs and documentation.
    * Analyzing system logs and error messages.
    * Profiling the application to identify performance bottlenecks.
    * Reversing the changes if they are confirmed to be the cause.
    * Implementing solutions to address the underlying performance issues.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The KPIs show clear deviations from the historical norms, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** 
    * **memory_usage:** Increased usage suggests potential memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased duration indicates potential latency issues within the Istio service mesh.
    * **cpu_usage:** Decreased usage might seem positive, but it could indicate underutilization or that some processes are not running efficiently.
    * **diskio:** A significantly reduced range suggests that disk I/O operations are significantly lower, which might be a symptom of a problem or a change in application behavior.
    * **net_recv_packet:**  Decreased received packets point to potential network connectivity issues or reduced data traffic.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced problems. The increased memory usage and latency could be related, while the other KPIs point to potential resource contention or network issues.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on investigating the root causes of the identified problems and taking steps to address them. This might involve reviewing configuration changes, optimizing resource allocation, troubleshooting network connectivity, and identifying and fixing memory leaks.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "Failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **cpu_usage:** Decreased significantly, indicating potential resource underutilization or issues with the code.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased significantly, suggesting problems with the service mesh (Istio) slowing down communication.
    * **memory_usage:** Decreased, which could be a sign of memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    * **diskio:** Decreased, potentially indicating less disk I/O activity, which might be unexpected.
    * **net_send_packet:**  Shows changes, suggesting network communication patterns have been affected. 

* **Reason:** The combination of these changes points to a failure. The decrease in CPU and memory usage, coupled with the increase in Istio duration, suggests that the change might have introduced inefficiencies or caused performance bottlenecks. 

* **Solution:**
    * **Investigate:**  Dive deeper into the code changes and the Istio configuration to pinpoint the root cause.
    * **Revert:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the system to a stable state.
    * **Performance Tuning:** Analyze resource usage patterns and optimize the code and configurations to improve performance.
