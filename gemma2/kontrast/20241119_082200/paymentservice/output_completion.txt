**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The KPIs showing the most significant deviations are:
    * `net_send_packet`:  Large negative and positive fluctuations.
    * `diskio`:  Shift from a low range to a range including negative values.
    * `memory_usage`:  Shift from a low range to a range including negative values.
    * `istio_count`:  Large fluctuations, indicating potential issues with service communication.
    * `istio_duration`:  Large fluctuations, suggesting problems with request processing times.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests that the change introduced issues with network communication, resource utilization, and service performance.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the problems. This could involve:
    * Reviewing the code changes made during the period of the change.
    * Analyzing system logs and events around the time of the anomalies.
    * Monitoring the affected KPIs closely to track the impact of any potential solutions.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this classification:

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant changes in KPIs like `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration` point towards a system malfunction. These deviations are not within historical norms, suggesting a failure.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen because they demonstrate the most significant changes and are directly related to system performance and resource utilization.

* **Reason:** The abnormal fluctuations in these KPIs strongly suggest that the change introduced instability and negatively impacted the system's performance. 

* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    * **Code Review:** Analyze the code changes to pinpoint the specific modifications that might have caused the issues.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine logs around the time of the anomalies to identify error messages, warnings, or unusual events that could shed light on the problem.
    * **Monitoring Data:**  Deep dive into system monitoring data (CPU, memory, network traffic) to understand the resource usage patterns before and after the change.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, consider rolling back the changes to restore the system to a stable state while investigating further.
    * **Mitigations:** Implement temporary measures to alleviate the immediate impact of the failure while working on a permanent solution.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five KPIs with the most significant changes are:
    * `net_send_packet`:  Increased range suggests a potential surge in network traffic.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased range indicates higher memory consumption, which could lead to performance bottlenecks.
    * `istio_count`: Increased range and wider fluctuations might signal issues with the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased range suggests that requests are taking longer to process, potentially due to increased load or configuration issues.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased range points to higher CPU utilization, which could be a bottleneck.
* **Reason:** The analysis of the KPIs reveals a clear pattern of performance degradation after the change.  The increased ranges and potential shifts in behavior patterns strongly suggest that the change introduced issues.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes to pinpoint the root cause.  Reverting the change or implementing mitigations to address the performance issues are potential remedies.
