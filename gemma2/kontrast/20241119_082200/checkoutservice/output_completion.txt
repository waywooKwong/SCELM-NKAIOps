Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify potential resource constraints.\n2. **Network Analysis:** Analyze network traffic patterns and bandwidth utilization to detect congestion or latency issues.\n3. **Application Logs:** Examine application logs for error messages or performance warnings related to the affected KPIs.\n4. **Service Health Checks:** Implement comprehensive health checks for the 'checkoutservice' and its dependencies to ensure proper functionality.\n5. **Configuration Review:** Review service configuration settings, particularly those related to network, resource allocation, and request handling, for potential misconfigurations.\n6. **Performance Tuning:** Optimize application code and infrastructure settings to improve performance and address bottlenecks identified through analysis."
