{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration",

	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to identify the cause of the increased CPU usage and memory consumption. Consider optimizing the code for better resource utilization. Monitor Istio metrics closely to identify potential bottlenecks and adjust configurations accordingly."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Change:** The provided metrics clearly indicate a deviation from normal behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `memory_usage`: Decreased after the change, indicating potential memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased significantly, suggesting the change is placing a heavier load on the system's processing resources.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, implying that requests are taking longer to process, potentially due to increased load or configuration issues within the Istio service mesh.

* **Reason:** The combination of these metrics points to a failure. The service is consuming more resources (CPU) and using less memory, which is unusual. The increased Istio duration suggests that the change is impacting the service mesh's performance.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific code changes responsible for the resource consumption and performance issues.
    * **Code Optimization:**  Improving the efficiency of the code to reduce CPU usage and memory leaks.
    * **Istio Configuration Review:**  Analyzing Istio settings to ensure they are optimized for the current workload and addressing potential bottlenecks.

}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning behind this classification:

* **Abnormal KPI Changes:**  The analysis clearly shows significant changes in several crucial KPIs after the change.  
    *  `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `istio_duration` increased, suggesting the system is working harder.
    * `diskio` decreased to zero, which is unusual and could indicate a problem with data access.
    * `net_recv_packet` showed fluctuations, implying network issues.

* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies, confirming that the system's behavior deviated from expected patterns. This strengthens the case for a failure.

* **Impact Assessment:** The combined effect of these KPI changes and anomalies points to a system performance degradation.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five KPIs with the most significant deviations are:
    * `memory_usage`: Decreased significantly, indicating potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.
    * `cpu_usage`: Decreased significantly, suggesting the system is underutilized or encountering performance bottlenecks.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, implying network communication delays or issues with the Istio service mesh.
    * `diskio`: Decreased significantly, potentially indicating I/O bottlenecks or issues with disk access.
    * `net_send_packet`: While a slight decrease, it contributes to the overall negative trend.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests that the change introduced problems within the system.  Decreased memory and CPU usage could indicate inefficient code or resource leaks. Increased `istio_duration` points to network issues, and the decreased `diskio` suggests potential I/O problems.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of these issues through investigation and review.  It also proposes optimization steps to address resource allocation, network settings, and potential I/O bottlenecks.

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, memory_usage, cpu_usage, diskio",
	"reason": "The analysis shows a significant shift in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  net_recv_packet and net_send_packet show a significant increase, while memory_usage, cpu_usage, and diskio exhibit unusual trends. This indicates a potential performance degradation and resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during the submission. Analyze the logs and system behavior around the time of the anomaly to pinpoint the root cause. Optimize resource utilization, consider scaling up resources if necessary, and monitor the affected KPIs closely after implementing any changes."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from the historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights  `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `diskio` as the primary culprits. 
* **Reason:** The described changes in these KPIs suggest a performance issue. Increased network traffic (`net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`), higher memory usage (`memory_usage`), increased CPU load (`cpu_usage`), and changes in disk I/O (`diskio`) all point to a potential resource bottleneck or inefficient code execution.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic approach:
    * **Code Review:** Scrutinize the code changes introduced during the submission to identify potential bugs or areas for optimization.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine system logs around the time of the anomalies to gain insights into the application's behavior and pinpoint any error messages or unusual events.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Analyze resource utilization patterns and consider scaling up resources (e.g., CPU, memory) if necessary.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor the affected KPIs after implementing any changes to ensure the issue is resolved and performance remains stable.

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "diskio, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'diskio' showed a sharp decrease, 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage'  experienced notable changes, and 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet'  indicated shifts in network activity. These anomalies suggest a potential disruption in the service's normal operation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to pinpoint the source of the anomalies.  Review logs and system configurations for any misconfigurations or unexpected behavior. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing temporary mitigations to restore system stability."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Change Type:** The significant deviations in KPIs like `diskio`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `net_recv_packet`, and `net_send_packet` strongly indicate a failure.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs show the most drastic changes, suggesting they are directly impacted by the change.

* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the changes caused a disruption in the service's normal operation, evidenced by the KPI deviations.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the failure through code review, log analysis, and configuration checks. It also proposes temporary measures to stabilize the system while a permanent fix is implemented.
