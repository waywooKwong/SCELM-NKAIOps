	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_count, diskio",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators.  'istio_success_rate' dropped dramatically, 'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet'  experienced large fluctuations, 'istio_count'  showed a reduced range, and 'diskio'  became consistently low. These indicate potential issues with network communication, service requests, and resource utilization.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this deployment to pinpoint the cause of these KPI deviations.  Review logs for error messages related to network connectivity, service requests, and disk I/O.  Consider rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigations to restore normal service operation."

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, istio_duration, istio_success_rate, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs related to Istio and network communication were observed after the change.  'istio_count' showed an increase, 'istio_duration' increased, 'istio_success_rate' drastically decreased, 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet'  also showed abnormal fluctuations. This indicates potential issues with the service's communication and performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the changes made to the checkout service and identify the specific modifications impacting Istio and network communication. Review logs and monitoring data around the time of the change to pinpoint the root cause. Consider reverting the changes or implementing targeted fixes to restore normal KPI values and service stability."

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_recv_packet, istio_success_rate, diskio, istio_count, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change indicate a failure.  net_recv_packet and istio_success_rate show drastic decreases, while diskio has become stagnant. istio_count and cpu_usage also exhibit unusual trends. These changes suggest the change negatively impacted system performance and communication.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Review logs and system events around the time of the change for further clues. Consider rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigations to restore system stability."

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_recv_packet, istio_success_rate, istio_count, diskio, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'net_recv_packet' and 'istio_success_rate' exhibit sharp decreases, indicating potential communication issues or service failures. 'istio_count' also shows a decrease, suggesting reduced service invocation. 'diskio' drops to zero, which might point to a problem with data access or storage. 'cpu_usage' shows a change in trend, potentially indicating a shift in resource consumption.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the KPI deviations. This could involve examining logs, monitoring system resource usage, and reviewing the code changes introduced.  Focus on resolving the issues affecting 'net_recv_packet', 'istio_success_rate', and 'diskio' as they appear to be the most critical. Consider rolling back the change if the investigation points to a faulty implementation."
