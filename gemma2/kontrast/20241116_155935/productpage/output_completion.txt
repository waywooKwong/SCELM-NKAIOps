	"reason": "The metrics analysis reveals a significant deviation in 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' after the change. Both KPIs show a downward trend in success rate and a decrease in overall requests. This suggests the change may have negatively impacted the service's performance and availability.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift, focusing on areas related to request handling and success logic. \n2. **Analyze logs for errors:** Investigate system logs for any error messages or warnings coinciding with the change and the observed anomalies. \n3. **Revert the changes:** Consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state and monitor the KPIs for improvement. \n4. **Test thoroughly:** Once potential issues are identified and addressed, conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the service functions correctly and meets performance expectations."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The data indicates a significant shift in the 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' KPIs after the change. While both KPIs show a downward trend, the magnitude of the shift is notable. This suggests that the change may have negatively impacted the system's ability to process requests successfully.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects related to request handling. \n2. **Analyze logs:** Examine system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the changes in 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. This can help pinpoint the source of the issue. \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' to identify patterns or further deviations. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Conduct further investigation:** If the root cause remains unclear, engage in deeper analysis, potentially involving profiling tools or expert consultation."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant deviation in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'.  The 'request_success_rate' showed a sudden increase and remained abnormal, indicating potential issues with service functionality. Additionally, 'request_count' exhibited an upward trend after the change, suggesting increased load or potential bottlenecks. The anomaly detection algorithm also flagged these KPIs, further supporting the classification as a failure.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:** Review the recent code modifications made before the data shift to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences. \n2. **Analyze logs and metrics:** Examine system logs and metrics from both pre-change and post-change periods to pinpoint the exact time and source of the anomalies. \n3. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' to identify patterns or further deviations. \n4. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting system functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Optimize system resources:** Analyze the increased load on the system and consider optimizing resources such as CPU, memory, or network bandwidth to improve performance."
