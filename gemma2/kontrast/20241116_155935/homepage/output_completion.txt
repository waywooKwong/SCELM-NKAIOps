{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as request_success_rate and request_count.  The request_success_rate dropped to 0.0 after the change, indicating a complete failure in processing requests.  The request_count also shifted from a stable range to a much wider range, suggesting potential issues with request handling or system instability. These anomalies, coupled with the SCWARN algorithm identifying anomalies at specific timestamps, strongly suggest the change introduced a failure.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact. \n2. **Investigate the code changes:** Carefully review the code modifications made before the data shift to identify potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n3. **Analyze system logs:** Examine logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the anomalous KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations. \n5. **Engage with development team:** Collaborate with the development team to understand the rationale behind the changes and work towards a solution."

	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key KPIs, including 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'. These anomalies indicate a potential disruption in service functionality. For example, 'request_success_rate' dropped to 0.0 after the change, suggesting a complete failure in processing requests. This deviation from historical norms and the emergence of new log patterns strongly suggest a failure.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes implemented to restore the system to its previous state. \n2. **Investigate the code changes:** Thoroughly review the code modifications made before the change to identify the root cause of the anomalies. \n3. **Analyze logs and metrics:** Examine system logs and metrics from both pre-change and post-change periods to pinpoint the exact time and source of the deviations. \n4. **Test the system:** After implementing a fix, conduct thorough testing to ensure the system is functioning correctly and the anomalies have been resolved."

```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs). Notably, 'request_success_rate' shifted from a positive range to a zero range, indicating a potential failure in processing requests.  'request_count' also exhibited a drastic change in range, suggesting a disruption in expected request patterns. This indicates a potential issue with the implemented changes affecting the service's core functionality.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift, focusing on areas related to request handling and processing. \n2. **Analyze logs:** Investigate system logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI anomalies. \n3. **Rollback the changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting service functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' to identify patterns or further deviations. \n5. **Conduct further investigation:** If the root cause remains unclear, engage in deeper analysis, potentially involving profiling tools or expert consultation."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant shift in the data ranges and trends for  'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. The 'request_success_rate' dropped to 0, indicating potential issues with service availability or request processing.  'request_count'  showed a drastic increase in its range, suggesting a surge in requests or potential resource contention.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate the code changes:**  Review the recent code modifications to identify potential bugs or misconfigurations that could be causing the observed anomalies. \n2. **Monitor system resources:**  Check CPU, memory, and network usage to identify any resource bottlenecks that might be contributing to the increased request count and decreased success rate. \n3. **Review logs:** Analyze system and application logs for any error messages or warnings related to request processing or service availability. \n4. **Rollback or revert changes:** If the anomalies are severe and impacting service functionality, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state. \n5. **Optimize request handling:**  Analyze the code responsible for handling requests and identify opportunities for optimization to improve performance and reduce resource consumption."
