**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear signs of degradation after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The chosen KPIs are those with the most significant and concerning changes:
    * `istio_duration`:  A large increase indicates potential delays in service requests.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A large upward shift might suggest unexpected success scenarios or flawed error handling.
    * `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`: Increased resource consumption points to potential performance bottlenecks.
    * `net_recv_packet`:  Fluctuations could indicate network issues or inefficient data handling.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows that the KPIs moved outside their normal ranges after the change, indicating a negative impact.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the source of the problem and taking corrective action. This involves:
    * **Code Review:** Examining the changes made to understand their potential impact.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Studying logs around the anomaly timestamps to identify patterns or errors.
    * **System Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring the KPIs to track the effectiveness of any solutions implemented.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs).  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate'  show increased negative values, indicating potential performance degradation. 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage'  increased after the change, suggesting higher resource consumption. 'net_recv_packet' also saw a significant increase, potentially indicating network congestion.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during the 'adservice' update.  Focus on areas that might be causing increased resource utilization, performance bottlenecks, or network traffic.  Review logs for any error messages or unusual patterns that correlate with the observed anomalies.  Consider rolling back the change or implementing mitigations to address the identified issues."

{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "The post-change metrics show significant deviations from historical norms.  istio_duration and istio_success_rate have increased and decreased respectively, indicating potential issues with service performance and reliability. CPU and memory usage have also increased, suggesting resource contention. Network metrics like net_send_packet and net_recv_packet show changes in traffic patterns, potentially due to the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced in the 'id:NO.40007' service update. Focus on areas that might impact service performance, resource utilization, and network communication. Review logs and system monitoring data for more detailed insights into the cause of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the change or implementing targeted fixes to restore normal system behavior."

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "The KPIs istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, and istio_count show significant deviations after the change.  istio_success_rate dropped, CPU and memory usage decreased, and network packet reception decreased. This indicates a potential performance degradation and system instability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this period.  Review logs for errors or warnings related to the affected services.  Monitor the KPIs closely and adjust system resources if necessary. Consider rolling back the changes if the issue persists."

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, indicating potential issues with request handling.  'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' decreased, which could suggest inefficient resource utilization or a problem with the deployed code. 'net_recv_packet' also decreased, implying reduced network activity, and 'istio_count'  showed a shift in behavior. These anomalies suggest the change negatively impacted system performance and stability.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications introduced during the change to identify potential bugs or areas of inefficiency. 2. **Monitor resource utilization:** Continuously track CPU, memory, and network usage to pinpoint resource bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation. 3. **Investigate network traffic:** Analyze network logs and traffic patterns to understand the reasons behind the decrease in 'net_recv_packet'. 4. **Test and debug:** Conduct thorough testing and debugging to isolate and resolve the root cause of the anomalies. 5. **Rollback if necessary:** If the issues persist, consider rolling back the change to the previous stable state."
