**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided data clearly shows a drastic change in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs showing the most significant deviations are:
    * `istio_success_rate`: Dropped to 0, indicating complete failure of communication within the service mesh.
    * `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `istio_duration`: All show increased volatility and deviations from historical norms, suggesting resource contention, increased latency, and potential instability. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a failure. The change likely introduced bugs or misconfigurations that are causing the service to malfunction. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to resolving the issue:
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous stable state.
    * **Investigation:** Thoroughly analyze the code changes and system logs to identify the exact cause of the failure.
    * **Optimization:** Once the root cause is found, implement appropriate solutions to address resource contention, latency issues, and any other performance bottlenecks.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided KPI data clearly shows a negative impact after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs exhibit the most significant deviations, indicating major issues.
* **Reason:** The drastic drop in `istio_success_rate` points to communication failures within the service mesh. The increased variability and deviations in other KPIs suggest resource contention or performance bottlenecks.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on debugging the change and understanding its impact on the system.
