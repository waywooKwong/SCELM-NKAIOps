Review the code changes implemented during the change window and identify potential areas for optimization. Consider adjusting resource allocation or implementing performance tuning strategies to mitigate the observed issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the post-change KPI analysis reveals significant deviations from historical norms. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs with the most notable changes are `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`. These indicate potential problems with network communication, disk I/O, memory consumption, and service invocation performance.
* **Reason:** The increased ranges and fluctuations in these KPIs strongly suggest that the change introduced issues affecting the system's performance and resource utilization.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to address the failure:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Determine the exact reason for the performance degradation by examining the code changes and system logs.
    * **Code Review:** Carefully review the code modifications made during the change to identify potential bugs, inefficiencies, or unintended consequences.
    * **Performance Tuning:**  Implement strategies to optimize resource allocation, reduce memory consumption, improve network communication, and enhance service invocation efficiency.

**Explanation:**

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "diskio", "memory_usage", "istio_count", "istio_duration", and "cpu_usage" are selected as the top abnormal KPIs due to their substantial increases after the change.
* **Reason:** The increased values in these KPIs point towards potential resource bottlenecks or inefficiencies introduced by the change. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the increased resource consumption through code review and optimization. Scaling up system resources might be a temporary measure if the issue cannot be resolved immediately through code changes.

Expected Software Changes
```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration",
	"reason": "The system experienced significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  \n\n* **net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration:** These KPIs showed sudden increases in their minimum and maximum values, indicating a potential surge in network traffic, disk I/O, memory consumption, and Istio request volume. This suggests a possible overload or resource contention issue.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased resource utilization. Analyze logs and system activity to identify any specific processes or requests contributing to the spike. Consider scaling resources, optimizing application performance, or adjusting network configurations to alleviate the strain."

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The most significant deviations are observed in `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`. These KPIs are directly related to system resource consumption and network activity.
* **Reason:** The sudden increases in these KPIs point to a potential overload or resource contention issue within the system. This could be caused by various factors, such as a surge in user traffic, a faulty application, or misconfigured system settings.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the increased resource utilization. This involves analyzing system logs, monitoring application performance, and reviewing network configurations. Based on the findings, appropriate actions can be taken, such as scaling resources, optimizing applications, or adjusting network settings to restore system stability.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  net_send_packet, diskio, memory_usage, istio_count, and istio_duration  show increased volatility and deviations from historical norms. This suggests the change negatively impacted system performance.",
