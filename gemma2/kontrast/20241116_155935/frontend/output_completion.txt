**Explanation of the Classification:**

* **Failure Change:** The provided data clearly indicates a failure because several key performance indicators (KPIs) have shown significant deviations from their pre-change norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selection focuses on KPIs that directly reflect system performance and stability:
    * **`istio_success_rate`:** A sharp drop suggests problems with communication and service interactions within the system.
    * **`istio_duration`:** A significant increase indicates delays in service requests, potentially impacting user experience.
    * **`net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet`:**  Increased ranges and potential spikes suggest network congestion or issues with data transmission.
    * **`memory_usage`:**  An increase could point to memory leaks or inefficient resource utilization within the deployed code.

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the changes introduced during the deployment have negatively impacted the system's performance and stability.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to resolving the issue:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Focus on understanding the exact code changes that led to these performance problems.
    * **Rollback or Targeted Fixes:** Consider reverting to a stable version if possible or implement specific code corrections to address the identified issues.
    * **Monitoring and Remediation:** Continuously monitor system logs and performance metrics throughout the investigation and resolution process to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented solutions.

**Explanation of the Classification:**

* **Failure Change Type:** The significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) like `net_recv_packet`, `istio_count`, `istio_success_rate`, `net_send_packet`, and `memory_usage` point towards a failure. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs are chosen because they demonstrate the most significant changes after the change was implemented.
* **Reason:** The increase in network packet reception and transmission (`net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`), coupled with a decrease in `istio_success_rate`, suggests that the changes might be causing communication issues or increased network load. The rise in `memory_usage` indicates potential memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  We classify this as a "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The five KPIs with the most significant changes are:
    * `net_recv_packet`: Increased values suggest potential network congestion or issues with data reception.
    * `istio_count`:  Increased values could indicate problems with the Istio service mesh or increased traffic volume.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A decreased success rate points to failures in communication within the Istio mesh.
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased values suggest potential issues with data transmission or network performance.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory consumption could indicate memory leaks or inefficient resource utilization.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced problems with network communication, resource management, or potentially the functionality of the Istio service mesh.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Carefully examine the code changes to identify potential causes for the issues.
    * **Log Analysis:** Look for error messages or unusual patterns in the logs that might provide clues about the problems.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continue to monitor the affected KPIs closely to track the situation.
    * **Rollback:** If the issues are severe and cannot be quickly resolved, consider rolling back the changes to restore the previous state.
    * **Optimization:** Once the immediate problem is addressed, focus on optimizing resource allocation and addressing any underlying performance bottlenecks.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Change Type:** The provided KPI data clearly shows abnormal increases and decreases after the change, pointing towards a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs with the most significant deviations are:
    * `net_recv_packet`:  Increased range and potential for packet loss.
    * `istio_count`:  Increased range, potentially indicating issues with the service mesh.
    * `istio_success_rate`:  Significantly decreased, suggesting failures in service communication.
    * `istio_duration`:  Increased range, implying latency issues within the service mesh.
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased range, potentially indicating increased network load.
* **Reason:** The change introduced code modifications that negatively impacted the system's performance and stability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation to pinpoint the source of the problem, followed by appropriate remediation steps such as reverting the change, fixing the faulty code, or implementing performance optimizations.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_count, net_send_packet, istio_duration, memory_usage",
	"reason": "Several key performance indicators (KPIs) show significant deviations after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped dramatically, 'istio_count' decreased, 'net_send_packet' decreased, 'istio_duration' increased, and 'memory_usage' also showed a notable shift.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the provided KPIs demonstrate a clear negative impact on system performance after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs highlight the most concerning issues:
    * **`istio_success_rate`:** A drastic decrease suggests problems with service communication and request handling.
    * **`istio_count`:** A decrease in the number of successful istio operations further supports communication issues.
    * **`net_send_packet`:**  A decrease indicates potential bottlenecks in sending data, affecting overall throughput.
    * **`istio_duration`:** An increase means requests are taking longer to process, leading to latency problems.
    * **`memory_usage`:**  A notable shift upward could indicate memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to a failure in the change, likely due to flawed code or misconfigurations affecting service communication, performance, and resource management.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the changes made and a focus on:
    * **Code Review:**  Analyzing the code for potential bugs or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examining system logs to identify error messages or patterns related to the affected KPIs.
    * **Metric Monitoring:**  Continuously monitoring KPIs to track the impact of any implemented solutions.
    * **Resource Optimization:**  Adjusting resource allocation and configurations to improve efficiency and address memory concerns.
