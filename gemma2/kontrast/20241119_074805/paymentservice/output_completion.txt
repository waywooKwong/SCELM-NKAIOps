	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "The provided data indicates that all key performance indicators (KPIs) remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations suggesting disruptions or performance degradation.  The anomaly detection system identified anomalies, but these appear to be transient spikes and dips, not indicative of a persistent failure. ",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal"  because KPIs are within historical norms and there's no evidence of a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs that indicate a failure.
* **Reason:** The analysis focuses on the absence of significant KPI deviations and the transient nature of the detected anomalies.
* **Solution:** "N/A" because no failure was identified, so no solution is required.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms, suggesting a failure.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The listed KPIs demonstrate the most drastic changes after the implementation.
* **Reason:** The substantial shifts in these KPIs point to a problem with the change, likely affecting network communication, resource utilization, and overall system stability.
* **Solution:** A systematic investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure. This could involve:
    * **Log Analysis:** Examining logs for error messages or unusual activity around the time of the change.
    * **Configuration Review:** Comparing configurations before and after the change to identify potential misconfigurations.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the change to its previous state to restore normal operation while further investigation takes place.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most notable changes are:
    * `net_send_packet`:  Large swings in values, indicating potential network issues.
    * `diskio`:  Unusual fluctuations, suggesting potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `memory_usage`:  Significant increase in memory consumption.
    * `istio_count`:  Large variations, pointing to problems with the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`:  Increased request processing times, likely due to issues within the Istio service mesh.
* **Reason:** The significant changes in these KPIs strongly suggest that the implemented changes introduced problems.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic investigation to pinpoint the source of the issue.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased significantly, suggesting network communication issues.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased, indicating potential memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * `istio_count`: Showed a large range, implying problems with Istio service mesh communication.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, suggesting delays in Istio-mediated requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased, indicating the system is under heavier load.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a failure in the change implementation. The increased network traffic, memory consumption, and service mesh delays suggest a breakdown in system performance.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes, log analysis, and potential rollback or temporary fixes to stabilize the system.
