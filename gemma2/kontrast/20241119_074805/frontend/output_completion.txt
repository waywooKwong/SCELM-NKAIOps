	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  istio_success_rate dropped drastically, net_send_packet showed a large increase in variance, istio_duration spiked, memory_usage decreased, and net_recv_packet showed a downward trend.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop indicates potential communication or processing issues within the Istio service mesh.
    * `net_send_packet`: A large increase in variance suggests erratic or unpredictable network behavior.
    * `istio_duration`: Spiked duration means requests are taking significantly longer to process, likely due to bottlenecks or errors.
    * `memory_usage`:  A decrease could indicate a memory leak or inefficient resource utilization.
    * `net_recv_packet`: A downward trend suggests a potential decrease in incoming network traffic or issues receiving data.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs strongly points to a problem introduced by the change. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic investigation to pinpoint the source of the problem and potentially rolling back the changes if necessary.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative impacts after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs demonstrate the most significant changes and potential issues:
    * `net_recv_packet`:  Increased volatility and a shifted range suggest network communication problems.
    * `istio_count`: Similar to `net_recv_packet`, increased volatility indicates potential issues with the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A  decreased success rate points to failures within the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: A much wider range indicates inconsistent performance and potential slowdowns.
    * `memory_usage`: A decrease in memory usage might seem positive, but it could indicate resource contention or inefficient memory management.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests that the changes introduced during this deployment negatively impacted the system's performance and stability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review, log analysis, and potentially reverting the changes or implementing performance improvements.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" - The data shows no significant KPI deviations or performance issues.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** "N/A" -  Since the change is classified as normal, there are no top abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights that KPIs are within expected ranges and there are no major performance drops. While the SCWARN algorithm flags anomalies, this doesn't automatically mean the change failed. Further investigation into the nature of these anomalies might be needed.
* **Solution:**  "N/A" - No solutions are required as the change appears to have been successful.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `istio_success_rate`: A significant drop suggests problems with Istio communication.
    * `istio_count`: A downward trend indicates fewer successful Istio operations.
    * `net_send_packet`: A decrease points to potential network issues or reduced data transmission.
    * `istio_duration`: An increase implies delays in Istio operations.
    * `memory_usage`: A shift in usage patterns could signal memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
* **Reason:** The combined effect of these KPIs indicates a disruption in system functionality, likely caused by the implemented change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Determining the exact source of the problem by examining logs, configurations, and the nature of the implemented change.
    * **Reversal or Mitigation:** 
        * If possible, revert the changes to restore the previous state.
        * If reverting is not feasible, implement strategies to address the specific issues identified in the KPIs (e.g., optimizing Istio configurations, troubleshooting network problems, improving memory management).

	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change indicate a failure.  \n* istio_success_rate dropped considerably, suggesting issues with service communication.\n* istio_duration increased, indicating slower request processing.\n* memory_usage decreased, potentially due to resource contention or a faulty application.\n* net_send_packet decreased, implying reduced data transmission.\n* cpu_usage remained relatively unchanged, suggesting that CPU resources are not the primary bottleneck.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased istio_success_rate and increased istio_duration. Review resource utilization and memory allocation to address potential issues with memory_usage. Monitor network traffic and analyze the cause of the reduced net_send_packet. Consider profiling the application to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize code."

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations observed in key performance indicators (KPIs) following the change.  'istio_success_rate' shows a drastic decrease, 'istio_duration' experiences a significant increase, and 'net_send_packet', 'net_recv_packet', and 'istio_count' exhibit unusual fluctuations. These anomalies suggest a disruption in the system's normal operation.",
	"solution": "Investigate the configuration changes made during the deployment to identify potential issues affecting the Istio service. Analyze logs and metrics related to network traffic and service communication to pinpoint the source of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing temporary mitigations to restore system stability."

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the substantial negative impact on several critical KPIs.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The selected KPIs highlight issues with Istio service performance and network communication.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a decline in 'istio_success_rate', indicating a failure rate increase.  'istio_duration' increasing suggests latency problems.  Fluctuations in 'net_send_packet', 'net_recv_packet', and 'istio_count' point to instability in network traffic and service interactions.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the recent changes, analyzing logs for clues, and potentially reverting the changes if necessary.
