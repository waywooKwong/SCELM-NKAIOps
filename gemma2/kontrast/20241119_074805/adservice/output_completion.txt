**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  
    * `istio_duration`: Increased significantly, indicating slower processing times.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased, suggesting a higher rate of failed requests.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased, potentially leading to resource constraints.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Fluctuated unusually, indicating potential network issues.
    * `istio_count`:  While it increased, the unusual fluctuation pattern suggests a problem.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to a failure.  The system is slower, less reliable, using more memory, and experiencing network instability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a thorough investigation to pinpoint the cause of the failure and then implement appropriate fixes. Continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure the solution is effective.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant negative changes post-change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs are directly related to service performance, resource utilization, and network traffic.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a downward trend in KPIs like `istio_duration` and `istio_success_rate`, suggesting issues with request handling and service responsiveness. Changes in `cpu_usage` and `memory_usage` indicate potential resource bottlenecks. The decrease in `net_recv_packet` might point to a problem with network connectivity or reduced traffic.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific code changes that led to the KPI deviations.
    * **Log and Monitoring Review:**  Examining logs and system metrics for more detailed insights into the issues.
    * **Rollback:**  If the impact is severe, consider reverting the changes to restore stable performance.
    * **Alternative Solutions:** Explore alternative solutions to address the performance problems identified.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **No Exceeding Thresholds:** The analysis states that the indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is the definition of a normal state.
* **Stable KPIs:** The descriptions of the KPIs before and after the change show no drastic shifts or trends that would suggest a failure.
* **Absence of Failure Indicators:** The analysis doesn't mention any significant error rates, decreased system availability, or other symptoms typically associated with a failure.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** 
    *  `istio_duration`: Increased significantly, indicating slower processing times.
    *  `istio_success_rate`:  Decreased significantly, meaning requests are failing more often.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased, suggesting the service is consuming more memory than before.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to a performance regression. The increased duration and decreased success rate suggest problems with the service's ability to handle requests efficiently. The increased memory usage could be a contributing factor or a symptom of the issue.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Understanding *why* the changes introduced the performance problems.
    * **Resource Optimization:**  Making the service use memory more efficiently to reduce the strain.
    * **Latency Reduction:**  Implementing caching or other techniques to speed up request processing.
