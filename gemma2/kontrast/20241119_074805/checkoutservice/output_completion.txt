{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, net_send_packet, istio_count, diskio, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped drastically, 'net_send_packet' and 'istio_count'  show reduced values, 'diskio' is consistently at zero, and 'cpu_usage'  decreased considerably. This suggests potential issues with service communication, resource utilization, and overall system performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the 'istio_success_rate' drop. Review logs and monitoring data for the affected services.  Examine the configuration of 'istio' and ensure proper communication between services. Analyze the 'diskio' anomaly to determine if there are any I/O bottlenecks. Optimize the resource allocation for 'cpu_usage' if necessary."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the substantial negative changes in several key KPIs.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The KPIs with the most significant deviations are:
    * `istio_success_rate`:  A drastic drop indicates potential issues with service communication.
    * `net_send_packet`: A decrease suggests reduced network activity.
    * `istio_count`: A reduction in the number of Istio requests could point to problems with service discovery or routing.
    * `diskio`:  Consistently at zero raises concerns about potential I/O issues or disk access problems.
    * `cpu_usage`: A significant decrease might indicate underutilized resources or a problem with the service's workload. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced problems with service communication, resource utilization, and possibly I/O.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Troubleshooting 'istio_success_rate':**  This is the most critical issue, as it directly impacts service communication.
    * **Analyzing 'diskio' and 'cpu_usage':** These anomalies need further investigation to rule out I/O bottlenecks or underutilized resources.

'istio_duration' shows a steady increase, 'net_send_packet' shows a steady increase, 'istio_success_rate' drops significantly, 'net_recv_packet' shows a large shift in range, and 'diskio'  shows a complete shift to zero activity.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because several KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  I've selected KPIs that demonstrate the most significant changes:
    * `istio_duration`:  Steady increase suggests potential performance bottlenecks in service communication.
    * `net_send_packet`: Steady increase could indicate increased network load or issues with sending data.
    * `istio_success_rate`:  A significant drop means a higher percentage of requests are failing, which is a major problem.
    * `net_recv_packet`:  Large shift in range implies unpredictable network traffic patterns.
    * `diskio`:  Shifting to zero activity suggests potential issues with data storage or access.
* **Reason:** The combined effects of these abnormal KPIs point to a systemic issue introduced by the change. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review and log analysis.  Rolling back the change is a common first step to restore stability, while temporary mitigations can be implemented to address immediate concerns.
