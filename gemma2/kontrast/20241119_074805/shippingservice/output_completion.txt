There are no significant deviations indicating disruptions or performance degradation.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Normal Change:** The analysis indicates that while there were anomalies detected, they were transient and recovered to normal. Key performance indicators (KPIs) did not show significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Reason:** The fluctuations in KPIs can be attributed to various factors like system load variations and network traffic. The absence of persistent abnormal trends suggests that the change did not negatively impact system performance.
* **Solution:** Since the change is classified as normal, no specific solution is required. Continuous monitoring of KPIs is recommended to ensure system stability.

	"reason": "The provided data indicates that no KPIs exceed their defined thresholds. All metrics remain within historical norms, suggesting a normal change.",
	"solution": "Not applicable as the change is classified as normal."
}
``` 


Let me break down why this classification was made:

* **No Threshold Exceedances:** The key point is that the analysis states "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold, which is considered normal." This directly aligns with the criteria for a normal change.
* **KPI Trends:** While some KPIs show shifts in their ranges (like `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `istio_duration`, and `net_recv_packet`), these shifts are not necessarily indicative of failure.  Changes in system behavior can occur without causing significant disruptions. Further investigation might be needed to understand the reasons behind these shifts.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The substantial drops in 'istio_success_rate', 'diskio', and 'memory_usage', coupled with the increase in 'istio_duration' and decrease in 'net_send_packet', clearly point to a negative impact on the service's functionality.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen because they directly reflect core aspects of the service's performance:
    * **'istio_success_rate':**  A low success rate suggests problems with communication and request handling within the service.
    * **'diskio' and 'memory_usage':** Reduced disk I/O and memory usage could indicate a bottleneck or inefficient resource utilization.
    * **'istio_duration':** Increased request processing times are a sign of performance degradation.
    * **'net_send_packet':**  A decrease in the number of packets sent could point to issues with data transmission or service availability.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests that the change introduced a bug or inefficiency that is negatively affecting the service's ability to process requests, communicate effectively, and utilize resources efficiently.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to resolving the issue:
    * **Code Review:** Carefully examine the changes made to identify the source of the problem.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Scrutinize logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns that occurred around the time of the change.
    * **Monitoring Data:** Analyze system monitoring data to pinpoint specific performance bottlenecks or resource constraints.
    * **Rollback:**  If a quick fix is needed, consider rolling back the change to restore the previous stable state.
    * **Permanent Fix:** Develop and implement a permanent solution that addresses the root cause of the performance issues.

    * No KPIs exceed thresholds or indicate abnormal behavior patterns.
