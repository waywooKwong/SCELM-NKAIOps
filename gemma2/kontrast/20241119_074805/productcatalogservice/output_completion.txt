``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "normal" because the KPIs are within historical norms and there are no indications of system disruption.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" because there are no KPIs that are significantly abnormal.
* **Reason:** The analysis of KPI changes shows no significant deviations or performance degradations. The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies, but these are likely transient fluctuations rather than persistent issues. 
* **Solution:** "N/A" because there are no issues to address.

{

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators. Memory usage decreased, CPU usage increased with a wider range, and istio_duration showed a higher maximum value. These indicate potential resource contention or increased processing load after the change.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced to identify the source of increased CPU usage and memory consumption. Optimize the code to reduce resource utilization. Monitor system logs and performance metrics closely after implementing the solution to ensure stability."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes:
    *  `memory_usage` decreased significantly. While this might seem positive, it could indicate memory leaks or inefficient memory management.
    *  `cpu_usage` increased with a wider range, suggesting the system is working harder.
    *  `istio_duration`  shows a higher maximum value, potentially indicating increased latency in service communication.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** We list the three most concerning KPIs:
    *  `memory_usage`: The significant decrease is a major red flag.
    *  `cpu_usage`: The increased range and higher values point to potential performance bottlenecks.
    *  `istio_duration`: Higher latency can impact overall system responsiveness.

* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states the observed changes and their potential implications: resource contention, increased processing load, and potential latency issues.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Identifying the root cause:** Analyzing the code changes to pinpoint the source of the problems.
    * **Optimization:**  Improving the code to reduce resource consumption and improve efficiency.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continuously tracking system performance after implementing the solution to ensure stability.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The significant deviations in multiple KPIs (network reception, CPU usage, disk I/O, and Istio metrics) point towards a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights the most impacted KPIs:
    * `net_recv_packet`:  Decreased, suggesting network problems.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased, indicating potential resource contention.
    * `diskio`:  Spiked, implying excessive disk activity.
    * `istio_count`:  Changed, suggesting issues with the service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`:  Changed, potentially indicating latency problems within the service mesh.
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests the change negatively impacted system performance, resource usage, and potentially the service mesh.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes, analysis of logs and system metrics, and potentially rolling back the change or implementing temporary fixes.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant changes in `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `istio_duration` point towards a negative impact on the system's performance.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The most impactful KPIs are:
    * `memory_usage`: A decrease in memory usage could indicate inefficient memory management or resource leaks.
    * `cpu_usage`: A decrease in CPU usage might suggest underutilization or a problem with the application's processing logic.
    * `istio_duration`: An increase in `istio_duration`  (likely related to service mesh traffic) indicates delays in communication between services, potentially causing performance bottlenecks.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests a disruption in the system's normal operation. The decrease in `memory_usage` and `cpu_usage` might seem counterintuitive but could indicate that the system is struggling to utilize resources effectively due to the increased `istio_duration`.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific changes that caused these performance issues.
    * **Resource Optimization:**  Addressing memory management, CPU utilization, and potential service mesh configuration issues.
    * **Monitoring:** Continuously tracking system performance metrics to detect and resolve any further problems.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The KPIs show clear deviations from the pre-change state, pointing to a negative impact.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs represent the most significant deviations:
    * **memory_usage:** Increased usage can lead to performance degradation and instability.
    * **istio_duration:** Fluctuations indicate potential problems within the service mesh, affecting communication and latency.
    * **net_recv_packet & net_send_packet:** Decreased ranges suggest potential network issues or reduced communication efficiency.
    * **diskio:** A significant decrease points to a possible bottleneck in disk access, impacting overall performance.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs indicates a failure scenario. Increased memory usage, communication issues, and disk access problems all contribute to a degraded system state.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on addressing the root causes identified by the abnormal KPIs:
    * **Memory:** Optimize code, adjust resource allocation.
    * **Network:** Troubleshoot connectivity, analyze istio_duration for bottlenecks.
    * **Disk:** Investigate potential access limitations, consider disk optimization.
