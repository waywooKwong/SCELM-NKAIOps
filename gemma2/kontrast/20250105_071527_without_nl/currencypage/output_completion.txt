**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "normal"**: The data explicitly states that all indicator data falls within expected thresholds. There are no mentions of KPIs exceeding thresholds or unusual trends, indicating normal performance. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: Since the change is classified as normal, there are no abnormal KPIs to list.
* **reason**:  The analysis confirms that all KPIs remain within historical norms and show no significant deviations. The absence of reported anomalies further supports this classification.
* **solution**: As the change is deemed normal, no solution is required at this time.

Let me break down my reasoning:

* **Anomaly Detection:** The presence of anomalies detected by SCWARN is noted. However, without details about how KPIs were affected during these anomaly periods, it's premature to label the change as a failure. 
* **Missing KPI Data:** The absence of specific KPI data related to these anomalies prevents a conclusive assessment of their impact on system performance.

Without further information about the nature and extent of the anomalies and their effect on KPIs, it is reasonable to classify this change as "normal."

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided information strongly points towards a failure change. The explicit mention of "Deleting White List by Mistake" coupled with the "Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" label clearly indicates a human error during the change process. This directly impacted system behavior, as evidenced by SCWARN's anomaly detection. 
* **Top Abnormal KPIs:** While specific values are missing, it's highly likely that system latency (increased), error rates (significantly higher), uptime (potentially decreased), and throughput (likely reduced) were among the most affected KPIs.
* **Reason for Failure:** The primary reason is a configuration error introduced during the change.  Deleting the white list without proper understanding of its function likely caused unintended consequences, disrupting system operation. 
* **Solution:** A multi-pronged approach is needed: immediate rollback, thorough log analysis to understand the error's extent, correcting the misconfigured white list, and rigorous testing to ensure stability after remediation.

Let me break down my reasoning:

* **Change Type:**  'normal' because while the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies, it didn't identify persistent performance degradations. The absence of KPI breaches and consistent data points within expected ranges suggest the change functioned as intended.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: Null - As there were no significant deviations in KPIs exceeding thresholds.

* **Reason:**  The SCWARN flags might indicate temporary glitches or events that didn't significantly impact overall system performance. The absence of sustained KPI issues and remaining data within acceptable ranges lead to the 'normal' classification.

    * Indicator data exceeding thresholds and a new log pattern are explicitly stated as abnormal indicators of failure in the provided context.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**: You'll need to replace "[KPI1],[KPI2],[KPI3],[KPI4],[KPI5]" with the actual top 5 KPIs showing abnormalities from your system data. Make sure these KPIs are NOT related to 'build' processes.

* **Impact Assessment:** The lack of major KPI deviations and the absence of reported system impact despite some anomaly detection lead to a "normal" classification.
* **Anomaly Detection:** SCWARN flagged anomalies at specific timestamps.  The crucial point is that these anomalies are *not* correlated with negative service performance impacts.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Anomaly Detection:** The core indicator is the SCWARN anomaly detection.  This algorithm is designed to flag deviations from expected behavior, strongly suggesting that the change introduced problems. 

* **Lack of KPI Data:** While you provided an empty JSON for KPIs, the presence of the anomaly signal is enough to classify this as a failure.

**Important Notes:**

* **Further Investigation:** The solution I've suggested requires a deeper dive into logs and system data to pinpoint the exact cause of the anomaly. 
* **Context Matters:** If there were known issues or planned maintenance coinciding with the anomaly time, it might change the classification.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The presence of multiple anomalies detected by SCWARN strongly suggests a failure. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** While specific KPI values are not provided, the anomaly timestamps identified by SCWARN serve as indicators. These timestamps need to be investigated further to determine which KPIs were affected.
* **Reason:** The SCWARN algorithm is designed to flag deviations from normal behavior. Its detection of anomalies points to a problem introduced by the change. 
* **Solution:** A systematic approach is needed:
    1. **Log Analysis:** Examine logs around the anomaly timestamps for error messages, unusual activity, or performance degradation clues.
    2. **Code Review:** Carefully review the code changes made during the period of the anomaly to identify potential issues (e.g., logic errors, incorrect configurations).
    3. **Metric Deep Dive:**  Analyze the specific KPIs at the anomaly timestamps to understand the nature and extent of the deviations.
    4. **Remediation and Testing:** Implement fixes based on the analysis findings and thoroughly test the system to ensure the issue is resolved.

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **"Failure" Change Type:** The provided information clearly points towards a "failure" classification. The SCWARN algorithm flagging anomalies and indicator data exceeding thresholds are strong indicators of a system malfunction. 
*   **Placeholder for KPIs:** I've used `[KPI1]`, `[KPI2]`, etc., as placeholders because the specific KPI names causing the anomaly aren't provided in your initial dataset. You'll need to replace these with the actual KPIs identified by your monitoring system.
*   **Reason:** The reason emphasizes the combined evidence of anomalies and exceeding thresholds, suggesting a deviation from normal behavior that requires investigation.
