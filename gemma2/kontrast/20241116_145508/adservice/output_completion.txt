	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show major increases in variability, indicating potential issues with request processing. 'memory_usage'  increased, suggesting resource contention.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The selected KPIs highlight areas of concern:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased variability suggests issues with request processing time.
    * `istio_success_rate`:  Significant increase in range indicates potential errors or failures in handling requests.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased usage points to potential resource contention.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Wider range suggests network fluctuations or potential issues with data transfer.
    * `istio_count`: Change in count could indicate altered traffic patterns or service behavior.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to a combination of factors contributing to the failure, including potential issues with request processing, resource contention, network fluctuations, and changes in service behavior.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review, resource monitoring, log analysis, and potentially rolling back the change if necessary.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from their historical norms, indicating a system disruption.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs highlight areas of significant change:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration suggests issues with request processing.
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drop in success rate indicates failures in handling requests.
    * `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`:  Increased resource consumption could point to inefficient code or resource contention.
    * `net_recv_packet`:  Unusual changes in network reception might indicate issues with data flow or network configuration.
* **Reason:** The combined impact of these KPIs points to a failure. The system is struggling to process requests efficiently, experiencing failures, and consuming more resources. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach:
    * **Code Review:** Analyze the recent code changes to identify potential bugs or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine system logs for error messages, warnings, or patterns that correlate with the KPI changes.
    * **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor system performance metrics to track the effectiveness of any implemented solutions.
    * **Rollback:** If the impact is severe, consider rolling back the changes to restore the system to a stable state.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change. istio_duration and istio_success_rate show substantial increases and decreases respectively, indicating potential issues with service performance and request handling. CPU and memory usage also spiked, suggesting resource contention.  Network packet metrics also show anomalies.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased resource consumption and performance degradation. Review recent code changes and configurations related to the adservice. Monitor system logs for error messages and performance bottlenecks. Consider scaling resources or optimizing code to address the issues."
