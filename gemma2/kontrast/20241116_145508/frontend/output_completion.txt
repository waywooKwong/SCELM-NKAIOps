	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations after the change. istio_success_rate dropped sharply, istio_duration increased significantly, and cpu_usage, net_send_packet, and memory_usage all show unusual trends. These indicate a potential issue with the service's performance and stability.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The significant drops in `istio_success_rate` and the sharp increase in `istio_duration` strongly suggest a problem with the service's communication and performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen because they represent core aspects of the service's functionality and health:
    * `istio_success_rate`:  A low success rate indicates communication failures between services.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration suggests slow response times, impacting user experience.
    * `cpu_usage`: High CPU usage can lead to performance degradation and instability.
    * `net_send_packet`: Unusual trends in network traffic could point to inefficient communication patterns.
    * `memory_usage`:  High memory usage can also cause performance issues and lead to system instability.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a failure in the service's ability to function correctly after the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solutions focus on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific reason for the changes in `istio_success_rate` and `istio_duration`.
    * **Resource Management:** Monitoring and potentially scaling resources (CPU, memory) to handle the increased load or address performance bottlenecks.
    * **Network Optimization:** Analyzing network traffic patterns to improve communication efficiency and reduce latency.

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The analysis states that KPIs remain within historical norms, and there are no significant deviations. This strongly points to a "normal" change.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Since the change is classified as "normal," there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.

* **Reason:** The key reason for the "normal" classification is the absence of significant KPI deviations.  While the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies, these are likely within expected operational ranges and don't indicate a failure.

* **Solution:**  Because the change is not classified as a failure, no specific solution is required.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because multiple KPIs show significant deviations from their pre-change behavior, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs highlight issues with network communication (net_recv_packet, istio_count, net_send_packet, istio_duration), service reliability (istio_success_rate), and memory usage (memory_usage).
* **Reason:** The analysis clearly states that the deviations in these KPIs point to a failure.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on a systematic approach to debugging:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the recent changes for potential causes.
    * **Log Analysis:** Scrutinize logs from the problematic timestamps to gain insights into the failures.
    * **Rollback or Fixes:** Depending on the findings, consider reverting the change or implementing targeted fixes.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change, indicating a disruption in system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The chosen KPIs represent key areas affected by the change:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A significant drop indicates problems with request processing within the Istio service mesh.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency suggests issues with routing or communication within the mesh.
    * `net_recv_packet`, `istio_count`, `net_send_packet`: These KPIs point to potential network issues or problems with data exchange between services.
* **Reason:** The analysis combines the KPI changes to paint a picture of a system experiencing communication and performance issues after the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting the configuration changes, examining logs for clues, and monitoring resource usage to pinpoint the root cause. Rolling back the changes is a temporary measure if the issue is severe.

**Explanation of the Classification:**

The analysis reveals several KPIs that show significant deviations after the change:

* **'istio_success_rate'**: This KPI indicates the percentage of successful requests made through Istio. The drastic decrease in the minimum value and the wider range suggest that a significant portion of requests are failing after the change. This could be due to misconfigurations, network issues, or problems with the service itself.

* **'istio_duration'**: This KPI measures the time it takes for requests to be processed through Istio. The increase in the maximum value and the shift in trend to 'down' indicate that some requests are taking significantly longer to complete. This could be due to increased load on the system, performance bottlenecks, or issues with the underlying infrastructure.

* **'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet'**: These KPIs measure the number of packets sent and received by the service. The increased ranges suggest potential network congestion or issues with the network infrastructure.

* **'istio_count'**: This KPI measures the number of requests processed by Istio. The wider range suggests potential instability in the communication flow, which could be caused by various factors such as network fluctuations or issues with the service itself.



The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced a failure.
