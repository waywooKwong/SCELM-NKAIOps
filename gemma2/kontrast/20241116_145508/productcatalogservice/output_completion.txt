``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because several KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `net_recv_packet`: A decrease in received packets suggests potential network connectivity problems.
    * `cpu_usage`: A significant increase indicates the service is under higher load than usual.
    * `istio_count`: An increase in Istio requests could point to issues with service mesh communication or configuration.
    * `diskio`: Increased disk I/O might indicate problems with data access or storage performance.
* **Reason:** The combination of these anomalies strongly suggests that the change introduced problems with network connectivity, resource utilization, service communication, and/or data access.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on addressing the root causes identified by the abnormal KPIs:
    * Network infrastructure investigation
    * Performance profiling and resource optimization
    * Service mesh configuration review and troubleshooting
    * Data access and storage performance analysis

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because several KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms, suggesting a negative impact on the system's performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The five most concerning KPIs are:
    * `memory_usage`:  A substantial increase, indicating potential memory leaks or inefficient memory utilization.
    * `cpu_usage`:  A noticeable increase, suggesting the system is under heavy load.
    * `istio_count`:  A significant increase, potentially indicating issues with the Istio service mesh or increased traffic.
    * `istio_duration`:  An increase, suggesting delays in service calls within the Istio mesh.
    * `net_send_packet`: A steady decrease, which might indicate a communication issue.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a failure in the change implementation. The increased resource consumption and potential communication issues suggest a need for further investigation and corrective action.
* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific cause of the increased memory and CPU usage.
    * **Performance Optimization:** Addressing bottlenecks in the code and optimizing resource allocation.
    * **Istio Mesh Review:** Analyzing the impact of the change on the Istio mesh and making necessary configuration adjustments.
    * **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring the affected KPIs to track the effectiveness of the solution and identify any further issues.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The decrease in memory usage and CPU usage, coupled with the increase in istio_duration, strongly suggest a failure. These KPIs indicate that the system is struggling to handle its workload efficiently.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **memory_usage:** A decrease in memory usage is unusual and could indicate a memory leak or inefficient memory management.
    * **cpu_usage:** A decrease in CPU usage could mean that the system is underutilized or that certain processes are not running efficiently.
    * **istio_duration:** An increase in istio_duration suggests network communication delays, which can impact overall system performance.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs points to resource contention issues and network bottlenecks. The system is likely struggling to process requests efficiently.
* **Solution:**  
    * **Code Review:** Analyze the code changes to identify potential issues related to memory management, resource allocation, and network communication.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Adjust resource allocation settings to ensure that the system has sufficient memory and CPU resources.
    * **Network Tuning:** Optimize network configurations to reduce latency and improve communication performance.
    * **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor KPIs to identify any further issues and ensure the system's stability.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs demonstrate a clear negative shift after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs are directly related to system performance and resource utilization. 
* **Reason:** The downward trends in network packet reception and sending, coupled with changes in memory, CPU, and disk I/O usage, strongly suggest a performance issue introduced by the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through analysis and potentially reverting the change if it's causing significant harm.  Resource optimization is a key aspect of addressing potential performance bottlenecks.

Let me break down the reasoning:

* **No KPI Exceeding Thresholds:** The analysis states that "all indicator data does not exceed the threshold." This means the KPIs, even after the change, are within acceptable ranges.
* **Anomaly Types:** The anomalies identified by SCWARN are classified as "recover to normal state." This means they were temporary spikes or dips that returned to normal levels. This further supports the conclusion that the change did not cause lasting negative impacts.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes, suggesting a problem.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The most concerning KPIs are:
    * **cpu_usage:** A significant decrease in CPU usage could indicate the service is not being utilized efficiently or there's a bottleneck elsewhere.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased istio duration suggests network communication is taking longer, potentially due to misconfigurations or network issues.
    * **memory_usage:** Decreased memory usage might seem positive, but a sudden drop could indicate a memory leak or process misbehavior.
    * **diskio:**  Decreased disk I/O could mean the service is not accessing data as expected, potentially leading to performance issues.
    * **net_recv_packet:** A decrease in received network packets points to a potential communication problem.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPI changes strongly suggests a failure. The service is not performing as expected, and there are signs of potential resource issues and communication problems.

* **Solution:** The proposed solution focuses on investigation and remediation:
