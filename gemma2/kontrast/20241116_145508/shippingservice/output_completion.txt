**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on several crucial KPIs after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The most impacted KPIs are:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic decrease suggests problems with service communication or routing.
    * `diskio`: A significant drop indicates potential disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased usage might point to memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * `net_send_packet`: Fluctuations imply network issues or increased communication load.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration for service calls suggests slowdowns or processing delays.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs indicates a system-wide performance degradation likely caused by the implemented change.
* **Solution:** A multi-pronged approach is needed:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the specific changes that led to these issues.
    * **Rollback:** If the impact is severe, consider reverting the change until the problem is resolved.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Analyze and optimize system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to handle the increased load.
    * **Network Monitoring:** Investigate network performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
    * **Code Review:** If applicable, review the code changes for potential bugs or inefficiencies.
