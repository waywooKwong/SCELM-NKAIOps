**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The provided data clearly shows a negative impact on system performance after the change. KPIs like `istio_duration` and `istio_success_rate` plummeted, indicating significant service slowdowns and potential failures. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list includes the most critical KPIs affected:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased latency in service requests.
    * `istio_success_rate`:  Decreased success rate of service requests.
    * `cpu_usage`:  Resource contention, possibly due to inefficient code or increased load.
    * `memory_usage`:  Memory pressure, potentially leading to slowdowns or crashes.
    * `net_recv_packet`: Unexpected increase in network data received, possibly indicating a misconfiguration or attack.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs points to a systemic failure. Performance is degraded, resources are strained, and network behavior is unusual.
* **Solution:** A multi-pronged approach is needed:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Thoroughly investigate what caused the change to negatively impact these KPIs. Review logs, system configurations, and code changes.
    * **Resource Optimization:**  Scale up resources (CPU, memory) if necessary to handle the increased load. Optimize code to reduce resource consumption.
    * **Network Troubleshooting:**  Investigate the cause of the increased `net_recv_packet` and address any misconfigurations or potential security threats.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor KPIs after implementing solutions to ensure stability and performance.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative trend after the change, pointing to a disruption in service performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** These KPIs were chosen because they show the most significant deviations from pre-change norms:
    * **istio_duration:** Increased latency in Istio requests, indicating potential bottlenecks or slowdowns.
    * **istio_success_rate:** Decreased success rate for Istio requests, suggesting failures or issues with service communication.
    * **memory_usage:** Increased memory consumption, which could lead to performance degradation or even crashes.
    * **cpu_usage:** Increased CPU usage, again pointing to potential resource contention and performance issues.
    * **net_recv_packet:** Decreased network receive packets, potentially indicating a problem with data flow or connectivity. 

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced issues into the system, causing performance problems and potential service disruptions.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on investigation and remediation:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the specific reason for the increased resource usage and performance degradation.
    * **Log Review:** Examine logs for any errors, warnings, or unusual events that occurred around the time of the change.
    * **Reversion:** If possible, consider reverting the change to restore the system to a stable state.
    * **Mitigation:** If reverting is not feasible, implement strategies to mitigate the performance issues, such as optimizing resource allocation, improving code efficiency, or addressing network bottlenecks.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  'istio_duration' and 'istio_success_rate' show substantial increases and decreases respectively, indicating potential issues with service performance. 'cpu_usage' and 'memory_usage' also show increased ranges, suggesting resource contention. 'net_send_packet'  exhibits a slight increase in range, which could be related to the other anomalies.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the increased resource usage and performance degradation. Review logs and system configurations related to the changes made. Consider scaling resources, optimizing code, or addressing potential bottlenecks."
