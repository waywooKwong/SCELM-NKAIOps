This can provide insights into the root cause of the issue. \n3. **Test affected functionalities:** Conduct thorough testing of the functionalities related to the 'view_cartpage' service to identify specific areas where the change might be causing problems. \n4. **Rollback changes (if possible):** If the anomalies are severe and impacting user experience, consider temporarily rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous state.  \n5. **Gather user feedback:** Collect feedback from users who have encountered issues with the 'view_cartpage' service to understand the specific problems they are facing.
