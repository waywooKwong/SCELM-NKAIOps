**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms and the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The list highlights the KPIs most affected by the change:
    * **net_send_packet:**  Unusual spikes and shifts in the range.
    * **diskio:** Unusual spikes and shifts in the range.
    * **memory_usage:** Unusual spikes and shifts in the range.
    * **istio_count:** Unusual spikes and shifts in the range.
    * **istio_duration:** Unusual spikes and shifts in the range.
* **Reason:** The metrics clearly indicate a negative impact on system performance. The unusual spikes and shifts in the KPIs suggest a malfunction or unexpected behavior introduced by the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause through code review, log analysis, and system monitoring.  It also considers rolling back the changes or implementing targeted fixes to restore stability.
