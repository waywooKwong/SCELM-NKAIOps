	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). Notably,  'net_send_packet', 'istio_success_rate', 'istio_count', 'net_recv_packet', and 'diskio' exhibit abnormal behavior with sustained increases, decreases, or shifts in their values. This suggests the change introduced issues in network communication, service reliability, and disk I/O performance.",
	"solution": "1. **Review the code changes**:  Thoroughly examine the code modifications introduced during the change to identify the root cause of the anomalies. Pay close attention to any changes related to network configurations, service dependencies, or disk I/O operations. 2. **Rollback the change**: If the anomalies are severe and impacting system stability, consider rolling back the change to the previous stable state. This will allow for further investigation and debugging while minimizing service disruption. 3. **Monitor and analyze**: Continuously monitor the affected KPIs after implementing any fixes to ensure the anomalies are resolved and system performance returns to normal.  Use detailed logging and tracing to pinpoint the exact points where the anomalies occur and gather more information about the underlying issues."
