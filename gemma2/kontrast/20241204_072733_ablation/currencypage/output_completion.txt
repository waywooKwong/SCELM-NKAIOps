**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs  'request_duration' and 'request_count' show substantial deviations from their pre-change behavior.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** "request_duration" and "request_count" are the primary indicators of failure.

* **Reason:** The significant increase in 'request_duration' suggests that requests are taking longer to process after the change. The increased 'request_count' indicates a potential surge in traffic or a change in user behavior that the system is struggling to handle.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on identifying the source of the problem through code review, log analysis, and resource monitoring. Reversing the changes or implementing performance improvements are potential remedies.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly show a shift from normal behavior to abnormal behavior after the change. The increased range and unexpected trends in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' indicate a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary KPIs affected. 
* **Reason:** The change likely introduced bugs or inefficiencies in the code that are causing requests to take longer to process and leading to fluctuations in request volume.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a systematic approach to diagnose and address the issue:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the changes made to identify potential errors or areas that might be causing performance problems.
    * **Log Analysis:** Analyze logs around the time of the anomalies to get more specific insights into what's happening during request processing.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, consider rolling back the change to restore the system to a stable state while further investigation is conducted.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement temporary workarounds to minimize the impact of the issue on users while a permanent solution is developed.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this classification:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The metrics 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show clear anomalies. The maximum values for both metrics have increased significantly after the change, indicating potential performance bottlenecks.
* **Trend Shift:** The overall trend for both metrics has shifted from a downward trend before the change to an upward trend after the change. This suggests that the change has introduced a factor that is causing the system to process requests slower and handle more requests.

* **Impact Assessment:** These changes in KPIs directly impact the user experience. Increased request duration leads to slower page load times, and a higher request count can strain system resources, potentially causing instability.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show significant deviations from their pre-change behavior. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary KPIs showing abnormal behavior.
* **Reason:** The drastic change in data ranges for these KPIs strongly suggests that the implemented change negatively impacted the system's performance. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the problem by examining the code changes and logs. Reversing the changes or applying a patch could be necessary to restore normal system operation.

**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The provided metrics clearly indicate a failure. The KPIs 'request_duration' and 'request_count' show abnormal behavior after the change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** 'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the primary indicators of failure.  The drastic changes in their ranges suggest a problem with how the service is handling requests.
* **Reason:** The significant changes in the KPIs point to a direct impact of the change on the 'currencypage' service's performance. 
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on code review and potential rollback to identify and fix the root cause of the performance degradation.
