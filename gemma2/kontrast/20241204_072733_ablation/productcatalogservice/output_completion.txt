**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates a **failure** change based on the following:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The metrics `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `diskio` all show abnormal trends after the change. This suggests a negative impact on the system's performance and stability.
* **Anomaly Detection:** The system's anomaly detection algorithm (SCWARN) identified anomalies at a specific timestamp, further confirming that the change introduced unexpected behavior.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the analysis.
