```json
{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_count, request_success_rate", 
	"reason": "The change resulted in anomalies in both 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.  While the 'request_count' range remained similar, the 'request_success_rate'  dropped to 0.0 after the change, indicating a potential failure in processing requests.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this service update. Focus on areas related to request handling and success logic. Review logs and debugging information around the time of the anomaly to pinpoint the root cause. Consider reverting the change or applying a fix to restore the expected request success rate."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The change is classified as a failure because the 'request_success_rate' KPI dropped to 0.0 after the change. This indicates a significant issue with the service's ability to successfully process requests.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The two most critical KPIs showing anomalies are 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.

* **Reason:** The drop in 'request_success_rate' strongly suggests a problem with the code changes. Even though 'request_count' seems relatively stable, the lack of successful requests points to a failure in handling or processing them.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes. Reviewing logs and debugging information around the time of the anomaly can help pinpoint the exact issue. Reversing the change or applying a fix to address the request processing failure is the recommended course of action.
