``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly show a negative impact.  The `request_success_rate` decreased, suggesting the service is handling requests less effectively. The `request_count` increased, potentially indicating problems with request processing or increased load.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The most significant anomalies are `request_success_rate` and `request_count`.
* **Reason:** The combination of these metrics strongly suggests a failure. The service is struggling to process requests successfully, and the increased request count might be a symptom of the service being overloaded or encountering errors.
* **Solution:**  A systematic approach is needed:
    * **Code Review:** Analyze the code changes made during the deployment to pinpoint the source of the problem.
    * **Log Analysis:** Examine system logs for error messages, warnings, or patterns that correlate with the anomalies.
    * **Metric Monitoring:**  Continue to closely monitor relevant KPIs to track the impact of any changes or fixes implemented.

}
``` 


**Explanation of Reasoning:**

* **Anomalous KPI Trends:** The shift in trends for 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' is a significant indicator. A decrease in success rate and a potential increase in request count (even if seemingly small) after a change usually points to issues with the service handling requests effectively.
* **SCWARN Algorithm:** The fact that the SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies suggests the system itself detected deviations from expected behavior patterns. This further strengthens the case for a failed change.

``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Failure Change:** The metrics clearly show a negative impact after the change.  Both `request_success_rate` and `request_count` decreased, indicating the service is not functioning as expected.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** I've focused on the two most impactful KPIs: `request_success_rate` and `request_count`. While other anomalies exist, these directly reflect the core functionality of the service.
* **Reason:** The decrease in `request_success_rate` suggests errors are occurring more frequently, while the drop in `request_count` implies users might be experiencing issues accessing the product page. The anomaly detection system further supports this conclusion.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation to pinpoint the source of the problem. Reversing the changes or implementing fixes are the next steps to restore normal service.

**Explanation:**

* **Reason:** The decrease in `request_success_rate` points to potential bugs or errors introduced by the change. The upward shift in `request_count` trend could indicate that the system is struggling to keep up with the increased load, leading to further errors.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a combination of debugging the code, analyzing system logs and resource usage, and potentially reverting the changes if necessary.

Review logs and system performance metrics to pinpoint specific areas of concern. Consider rolling back the changes or implementing temporary mitigation strategies to restore service stability."
