**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  'failure' because the metrics clearly indicate a negative impact.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  "request_success_rate" and "request_count" are the most significant as they directly reflect service functionality and user experience.
* **Reason:** The drastic drop in 'request_success_rate' to 0% and the change in 'request_count' distribution point to a problem with the implemented changes. 
* **Solution:**  A thorough code review is essential to pinpoint the faulty changes. A rollback might be necessary to restore stability.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count",
	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in the request_success_rate, dropping from a positive average to 0.0. Additionally, the request_count showed a sudden increase after the change, deviating from the previous downward trend. These anomalies suggest the change negatively impacted the service's performance and stability.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to identify the root cause of the decreased request success rate and increased request count. Review logs and system metrics to pinpoint specific areas of concern. Consider rolling back the change or implementing a temporary fix to restore service stability while a permanent solution is developed."
