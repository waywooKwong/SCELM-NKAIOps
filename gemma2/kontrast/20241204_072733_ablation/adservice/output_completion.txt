**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The listed KPIs are primarily responsible for the performance degradation observed. 
* **Reason:** The metrics clearly indicate a decline in system performance.  
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the source of the problem through code review, log analysis, and monitoring data.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_duration, istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet",
	"reason": "The change resulted in significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as istio_duration, istio_success_rate, cpu_usage, memory_usage, and net_recv_packet. These metrics indicate increased latency, decreased success rates, and resource consumption after the change.",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Failure Classification:** The metrics clearly show a negative impact after the change. Increased latency (istio_duration), decreased success rates (istio_success_rate), and higher resource usage (cpu_usage, memory_usage, net_recv_packet) all point towards a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The listed KPIs are the most directly affected by the change, demonstrating a clear pattern of degradation.
* **Reason:** The metrics directly demonstrate a performance decline following the change. 
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the source of the problem within the code changes and taking corrective action.
