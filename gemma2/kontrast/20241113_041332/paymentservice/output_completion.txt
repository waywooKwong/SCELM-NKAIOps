**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the KPIs  show significant deviations from historical norms after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The analysis highlights `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration` as the most significant KPIs experiencing abnormal behavior.
* **Reason:** The KPIs' increased volatility and deviations from historical norms strongly suggest a disruption in system performance caused by the change.
* **Solution:**  The suggested solution includes a thorough investigation to pinpoint the root cause of the anomalies, potentially rolling back the change if necessary, and continuous monitoring to address any further performance issues.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior after the change, indicating a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs are chosen based on the magnitude of the change and their potential impact on the system:
    * `net_send_packet`:  A sudden and large increase in packet sending could indicate a network issue or misconfigured application.
    * `diskio`:  Even slight changes in disk I/O can be significant. A sudden increase might point to inefficient data access patterns or a disk bottleneck.
    * `memory_usage`: A sharp increase in memory usage could suggest memory leaks or excessive resource consumption by the application.
    * `istio_count` and `istio_duration`:  Anomalies in Istio metrics might point to problems within the service mesh itself, affecting communication between services.
* **Reason:** The analysis combines the abnormal KPI ranges and trends with the `SCWARN` algorithm's anomaly detection, strongly suggesting a failure caused by the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Code Review:** Examining the changes introduced to identify potential bugs or misconfigurations.
    * **Log Analysis:** Investigating logs around the anomaly timestamps to pinpoint the source of the issues.
    * **Performance Monitoring:**  Continuously monitoring system performance to track the impact of any fixes.
    * **Rollback:** As a last resort, consider rolling back the changes if the issues are severe and cannot be quickly resolved.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  We select the KPIs with the most significant changes: `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`.
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly indicates performance issues:
    * `net_send_packet` increased significantly, potentially overloading the network.
    * `memory_usage` fluctuated with a negative mean, suggesting memory leaks or inefficient allocation.
    * `istio_count` and `istio_duration` had large ranges, indicating potential bottlenecks or delays in communication.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Understanding why the change caused these issues.
    * **Rollback:** If possible, revert the change to restore stability.
    * **Mitigation:** If rollback is not feasible, implement strategies to manage the increased resource consumption and network traffic.

Optimize system resources, monitor resource utilization closely, and implement performance tuning strategies to address the observed issues."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The provided data highlights abnormal changes in `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`. These KPIs indicate potential problems with network communication, disk I/O, memory management, and service mesh performance.
* **Reason:** The significant changes in these KPIs suggest that the change introduced instability or performance issues within the payment service. The increased volatility and deviations from normal behavior patterns point to a need for further investigation.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a multi-pronged approach:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:**  Identify the specific change that caused the abnormal behavior.
    * **Rollback:** If the recent change is suspected to be the primary cause, consider rolling it back to restore previous functionality.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Analyze system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) and optimize configurations to improve performance.
    * **Performance Tuning:**  Implement specific performance tuning strategies based on the identified bottlenecks.
    * **Monitoring:** Continue to closely monitor the KPIs and system logs to track the effectiveness of the implemented solutions and prevent future issues.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "net_send_packet, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration, cpu_usage",
	"reason": "The analysis reveals significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.  net_send_packet, memory_usage, istio_count, istio_duration, and cpu_usage show abnormal increases or decreases, indicating potential performance degradation and system instability.",

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased significantly, suggesting potential network congestion or issues with data transfer.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased, indicating potential memory leaks or inefficient memory allocation.
    * `istio_count`: Fluctuated significantly, suggesting problems with Istio service mesh communication or routing.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased, pointing to potential delays or slowdowns in Istio-mediated requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased, indicating the system is under heavier load and could be struggling to process requests efficiently. 
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced issues into the system, leading to performance degradation and instability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution involves a thorough investigation of the code changes and system logs to pinpoint the root cause.  Rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigations are recommended to restore system stability while the issue is being resolved.
