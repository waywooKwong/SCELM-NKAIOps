	"reason": "The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies in several KPIs, including istio_duration, net_recv_packet, istio_count, istio_success_rate, and memory_usage. These anomalies indicate a potential failure in the service. The 'Sudden increase', 'Steady increase', and 'Level shift down' anomalies in istio_duration suggest a performance degradation. The changes in net_recv_packet, istio_count, and istio_success_rate indicate a disruption in network communication and request processing. The increase in memory_usage could be a contributing factor to the performance issues.",
	"solution": "Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies.  Possible solutions include: \n\n* Monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, network) closely.\n* Analyzing logs for error messages or unusual activity.\n* Reviewing recent changes to the system configuration or code.\n* Scaling up resources if necessary.\n* Implementing performance optimization techniques."
