**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" because the provided KPI data clearly shows a negative impact after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most significant deviations are:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A drastic drop indicates problems with service communication.
    * `diskio`: Increased disk usage could point to inefficient data access or storage issues.
    * `memory_usage`: Higher memory consumption might suggest memory leaks or excessive resource allocation.
    * `istio_duration`: Increased request processing times indicate potential performance bottlenecks.
    * `net_recv_packet`:  Fluctuations in received network packets could signal network connectivity problems.
* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs strongly suggests that the change introduced issues affecting system performance, stability, and resource utilization.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

    1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the exact source of the problems by examining change logs, system resource usage, and application logs.
    2. **Rollback (if necessary):** If the impact is severe, consider reverting the change to restore the previous stable state.
    3. **Corrective Actions:** Implement fixes based on the identified root cause to address the performance bottlenecks, resource inefficiencies, and network issues.

	"reason": "Several KPIs show significant deviations from historical norms.  'net_send_packet' and 'net_recv_packet' exhibit sudden decreases, indicating potential network connectivity issues.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show a clear negative impact after the change.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** The list prioritizes the KPIs with the most drastic changes:
    * `istio_success_rate`: A significant drop suggests problems with service communication.
    * `diskio`: A rise could indicate disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory consumption might signal inefficient code or resource leaks.
    * `istio_duration`: Longer request durations point to performance issues within the service.
    * `net_recv_packet`: A wider range suggests network instability or increased traffic. 
* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a pattern of performance degradation after the change.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine the specific code changes or system configurations that led to the issues.
    * **Reverting Changes:** If the impact is severe, reverting the changes might be the quickest solution.
    * **Performance Optimization:** Address resource allocation, code efficiency, and system configuration to improve performance.
