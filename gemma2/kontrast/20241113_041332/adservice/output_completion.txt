'istio_duration' has a much larger maximum value and 'istio_success_rate' has a significantly lower mean, indicating potential performance issues. Increased 'cpu_usage' and decreased 'memory_usage' suggest resource contention.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment. Identify the specific components causing the increased resource consumption and performance degradation. Optimize the code to reduce CPU and memory usage. Consider scaling up resources if necessary."

``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  The analysis clearly indicates a "failure" because the KPIs show substantial negative changes post-change.  
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The selected KPIs are directly related to system performance and resource utilization.
* **Reason:** The provided KPI changes directly point to performance issues:
    * **'istio_duration'**: Increased duration suggests requests are taking longer to process.
    * **'istio_success_rate'**: A decreased success rate indicates failures are occurring more frequently.
    * **'cpu_usage'**: Higher CPU usage means the system is working harder, potentially leading to slowdowns.
    * **'memory_usage'**: Decreased memory usage could mean the system is running out of memory, causing instability.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the performance issues and implementing optimizations.
