**Explanation:**

* **change_type:**  Set to "failure" because the KPIs indicate a negative impact on system performance.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  These KPIs show the most significant changes after the change, suggesting they are key contributors to the failure.
* **reason:**  The analysis clearly states that the KPIs show deviations, indicating a failure, and the SCWARN algorithm's anomaly detection further supports this.
* **solution:**  Provides a structured approach to addressing the failure, including investigation, rollback if necessary, and performance optimization.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative deviations after the change, indicating a system degradation.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  The analysis focuses on the most impactful KPIs:
    * `net_recv_packet` and `net_send_packet`:  Decreases suggest potential network issues or reduced communication.
    * `memory_usage`: A sharp drop could indicate a memory leak or misallocation.
    * `cpu_usage`:  An increase points to the service being overloaded.
* **Reason:** The combination of  KPI changes and anomaly detection strongly suggests the change introduced problems.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of the performance issues.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The listed KPIs show the most significant deviations, indicating potential issues.
* **Reason:** The provided data directly supports the classification. Increased network traffic, potentially caused by inefficient code, and changes in memory/CPU usage suggest a problem. The shift in diskio range could indicate issues with data access or storage.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on code review and optimization to address the root causes of the performance degradation.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the KPIs show significant deviations from normal behavior, indicating a negative impact on the system.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The provided data highlights  `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `diskio` as the most problematic KPIs.
* **Reason:** The KPIs demonstrate clear abnormal trends after the change. The `SCWARN algorithm`'s anomaly detection further reinforces this, suggesting the change caused unexpected system behavior.
* **Solution:** A systematic investigation is needed to pinpoint the cause of the KPI deviations. This could involve:
    * **Change Log Review:** Examining the specific changes made to understand their potential impact on the system.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Analyzing system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify bottlenecks or excessive consumption.
    * **Application Log Analysis:**  Reviewing application logs for error messages, warnings, or unusual activity patterns that might correlate with the KPI changes.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_duration, memory_usage, diskio, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "The analysis reveals significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. CPU usage dropped drastically, istio_duration spiked significantly, memory usage decreased, diskio showed a sharp reduction, and net_send_packet experienced a change in trend. These anomalies indicate a potential disruption in system performance and functionality.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the abnormal KPI changes.  Review the change implementation for potential errors or unintended consequences. Monitor system logs and performance metrics closely. Consider rolling back the change if the issues persist. Optimize system resources and configurations to address performance bottlenecks."
