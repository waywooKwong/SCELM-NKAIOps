**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure. Here's why:

* **Significant KPI Shifts:** Both `request_duration` and `request_count` show drastic changes in their data ranges after the change. This suggests a fundamental shift in how the service is performing.
* **"Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" Incident:** This incident directly points to a potential misconfiguration as the cause of the anomalies. 
* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies at multiple timestamps, further confirming that the change introduced unexpected behavior.

``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a **failure**. 

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The `request_duration` has increased dramatically with values exceeding 16 seconds, and `request_count` has decreased significantly. These are substantial shifts from the pre-change behavior, pointing to a problem.
* **Incident Correlation:** The mention of "Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" strongly suggests a configuration issue directly related to the observed anomalies.

Based on these factors, the change is classified as a failure. The suggested solutions involve reviewing recent code changes, analyzing logs, investigating the incident, potentially rolling back the changes, and closely monitoring the affected KPIs.

**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure. Here's why:

* **Shifting Data Ranges:** The ranges for `request_duration` and `request_count` have drastically changed after the change. This indicates a significant deviation from the expected behavior.
* **Sudden Increase in Request Duration:** A sudden increase in `request_duration` suggests that the service is taking longer to respond, indicating potential performance issues.
* **Decrease in Request Count:** A decrease in `request_count` could mean that fewer users are interacting with the service, possibly due to performance issues or errors.
* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm identifies anomalies at specific timestamps, further confirming that the change caused unexpected behavior.
