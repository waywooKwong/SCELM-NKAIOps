	"reason": "The provided data indicates that the change did not result in any significant anomalies. KPIs such as request_count and request_success_rate showed shifts in their ranges, but these shifts are not considered drastic deviations from historical norms. The absence of flagged anomalies by the monitoring system further supports the conclusion that the change was within expected behavior.",
	"solution": "None"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that the change did not cause any major issues. Here's why:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:** While there were changes in `request_count` and `request_success_rate`, these shifts are not deemed drastic enough to signal a failure. 
* **No Anomaly Detection:** The monitoring system did not flag any anomalies, suggesting the change behaved as expected.
* **Absence of "Newly Generated Log Pattern":** The absence of a new log pattern indicates that the change did not introduce unexpected behavior or errors.
