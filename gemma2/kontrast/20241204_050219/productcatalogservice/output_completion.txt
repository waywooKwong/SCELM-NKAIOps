	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "While there are anomalies detected, the overall data trends remain within historical norms and no KPIs exceed defined thresholds.  The 'newly generated log pattern' requires further investigation to determine its impact, but it doesn't indicate immediate system degradation.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The analysis indicates that despite the presence of anomalies, the KPIs haven't significantly deviated from expected ranges.  

* **Anomaly Types:** The identified anomalies, while present, are classified as "recover to normal state." This suggests that the system might have experienced temporary fluctuations but returned to a stable state.
* **Log Pattern:** The "newly generated log pattern" requires further investigation. It might be benign or indicative of a change in system behavior.  
* **Pre-Approved Process:**  The analysis lacks information about whether a pre-approved process was followed.  This is crucial for determining if the change was implemented correctly.

**Important Note:**  While the current data suggests a "normal" change, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure the system's long-term stability and address any potential issues arising from the anomalies or the new log pattern.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "N/A",
	"reason": "While there were anomalies detected in the system, the provided data indicates that the KPIs remain within historical norms and there are no significant deviations in system performance. The SCWARN algorithm also did not identify any anomalies exceeding the defined thresholds.",
	"solution": "N/A"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" -  The analysis shows no significant KPI deviations or anomalies, suggesting the change did not negatively impact the system.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A" -  Since the change type is "normal," there are no abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The data indicates that KPIs like `net_recv_packet`, `net_send_packet`, `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, `diskio`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`  maintained their expected ranges and trends. The absence of anomalies further supports the classification as "normal."

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the clear negative trend in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**
    * `net_send_packet`:  A steady decrease suggests a potential communication bottleneck or issue with the service's ability to send data.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory consumption could indicate inefficient code or memory leaks.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased CPU usage points to the service being heavily loaded, potentially due to inefficient algorithms or resource contention.
    * `istio_count`: A higher number of service mesh calls suggests increased traffic or potential issues with routing.
    * `istio_duration`: Longer service mesh call durations indicate performance bottlenecks within the service mesh itself.

* **Reason:** The combination of these abnormal KPIs suggests that the change introduced inefficiencies or increased the load on the system, leading to performance degradation.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the code changes, optimizing resource utilization, and potentially scaling infrastructure to handle the increased load.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure** - The significant changes in CPU usage, disk I/O, memory usage, and Istio duration point to a clear performance degradation. 

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * **cpu_usage:** A sharp decrease suggests a process might be idle or inefficient, or there could be a resource contention issue.
    * **diskio:** A near-zero value indicates a potential issue with disk access or a process not utilizing disk resources.
    * **istio_duration:** Increased duration suggests network communication delays or issues within the Istio service mesh.
    * **memory_usage:** An increase might indicate memory leaks or inefficient memory management within the service.
    * **net_recv_packet:** While the overall trend is up, the change in range after the deployment suggests potential network communication issues.

* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs indicates a system-wide performance problem. The decrease in CPU usage and disk I/O might suggest a process issue, while the increase in memory usage and Istio duration point to potential resource contention or communication bottlenecks.

* **Solution:**  The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the specific reason for the CPU usage decrease and disk I/O drop.
    * **Resource Optimization:** Reviewing resource allocation, process efficiency, and memory management practices.
    * **Network Investigation:** Analyzing the increased Istio duration to pinpoint communication bottlenecks and potential network issues.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in network traffic (net_recv_packet, net_send_packet), memory usage, CPU usage, and Istio metrics (istio_count, istio_duration) were observed after the change. This indicates potential resource contention, increased load, or communication bottlenecks.",
	"solution": "1. **Investigate resource utilization:** Analyze system logs and monitoring data to identify potential bottlenecks or resource contention issues. 2. **Review application code:** Examine the code changes introduced to determine if they are causing increased resource consumption or inefficient communication patterns. 3. **Scale resources:** If necessary, consider scaling up server resources (CPU, memory) to handle the increased load. 4. **Optimize network configuration:** Review Istio settings and network configurations to ensure efficient service communication and minimize latency."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "Failure" because the KPIs show clear deviations from normal behavior, indicating potential issues.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**
    * `net_recv_packet` and `net_send_packet`: Increased network traffic suggests potential communication bottlenecks or increased load.
    * `memory_usage`: Increased memory consumption could indicate memory leaks or inefficient resource allocation.
    * `cpu_usage`: Higher CPU usage points to increased processing demands, which might be caused by the code changes or resource contention.
    * `istio_count` and `istio_duration`: Changes in Istio metrics (request count and duration) suggest issues with service communication and potential latency increases.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to a combination of factors:
    * **Resource Contention:** The increased resource usage (memory, CPU) suggests that the system might be struggling to handle the new demands.
    * **Communication Issues:** Changes in Istio metrics indicate problems with service communication, potentially leading to latency and performance degradation.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Identifying Bottlenecks:** Analyzing system logs and monitoring data to pinpoint the root cause of the resource issues.
    * **Code Review:** Examining the recent code changes to identify potential inefficiencies or bugs.
    * **Resource Scaling:** Increasing server resources (CPU, memory) if necessary to accommodate the increased load.
    * **Network Optimization:** Reviewing Istio configurations and network settings to ensure efficient service communication.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, memory_usage, diskio, istio_duration, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change. CPU usage decreased, memory usage decreased, diskio showed a drastic decrease, and net_send_packet's range also decreased. Istio duration showed a significant increase in maximum value. These indicate potential issues with resource utilization, network performance, and service latency.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the decreased CPU and memory usage. Analyze the increased istio_duration to identify potential bottlenecks or slowdowns in service communication. Review the configuration of diskio and network settings to ensure optimal performance. Monitor system logs for any errors or warnings related to these changes."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The change resulted in several significant KPI deviations, pointing towards potential issues:

* **Decreased CPU and Memory Usage:** This could indicate the service is not utilizing its resources effectively, potentially due to code inefficiencies or misconfigurations.
* **Drastic Decrease in DiskIO:** This suggests a sharp reduction in disk access, which might be caused by changes in data access patterns or potential issues with data storage.
* **Decreased Net_Send_Packet Range:** This indicates a reduction in network traffic sent by the service, which could be normal if the service's workload decreased, but further investigation is needed.
* **Increased Istio_Duration:** This signifies a significant increase in the time taken for service communication mediated by Istio. This could point to bottlenecks within the service mesh or network latency issues.

These combined anomalies strongly suggest the change introduced issues with resource utilization, network performance, and service latency.
