	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in 'request_success_rate' and a shift in the trend of 'request_count'. The SCWARN algorithm also flagged anomalies, indicating the change deviated from expected behavior patterns.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact. \n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Carefully examine the modifications made, focusing on areas related to request handling and success rate calculation. \n3. **Analyze logs and system events:** Investigate logs and system events around the time of the change to identify potential error messages, warnings, or unusual activity. \n4. **Monitor KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the affected KPIs to identify any recurring issues or further deviations. \n5. **Engage with developers and experts:** Collaborate with developers and system experts to diagnose the root cause of the anomalies and implement a permanent solution."
