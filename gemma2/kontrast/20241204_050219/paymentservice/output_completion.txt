``` 


**Explanation:**

While the `cpu_usage` KPI did show a single spike anomaly, it recovered to normal levels and didn't cause persistent performance problems. The other KPIs, such as `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `istio_success_rate`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`,  either remained stable or showed minor fluctuations within expected ranges. 

The absence of significant and sustained deviations in key performance indicators suggests that the change did not negatively impact the system's overall performance.

	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during the submission period to identify potential causes for the increased resource consumption and volatility. Consider optimizing code for efficiency, adjusting resource allocation, or implementing monitoring and alerting systems to proactively address future issues."
}
``` 


Let me break down the reasoning behind this classification:

* **Significant KPI Deviations:** The post-change data for `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, `istio_duration`, `diskio`, and `net_send_packet` show wider ranges and increased volatility compared to pre-change values. This suggests a disruption in the normal operation of the service.
* **Anomaly Types:** The presence of anomaly types like "Single dip" and "Transient level shift up" in `memory_usage` further points to instability in the system's resource usage.
* **Impact on System Performance:** While the provided data doesn't explicitly show degraded system latency or error rates, the KPI deviations strongly suggest potential performance issues that could lead to such problems in the future.

* **Stable KPIs:**  The data shows that KPIs like `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `istio_success_rate`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`  have relatively stable ranges before and after the change. While there are some shifts in the ranges, they don't indicate a significant negative impact.
* **Absence of Anomaly Detection:** The monitoring system didn't identify any anomalies, suggesting the change didn't cause any unexpected behavior patterns.

* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies at specific timestamps, indicating a pattern of unexpected behavior.
* **Impact Assessment:** The changes have negatively impacted system performance, as evidenced by the KPI deviations. 

The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the issues through code review and optimization.  Additionally, monitoring system resources and implementing scaling strategies are crucial to mitigate the impact of the change.

**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure. Here's why:

* **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies in `cpu_usage`, `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration`. These are crucial system metrics, and their abnormal behavior suggests a problem.
* **KPI Comparison:** The post-change data for these KPIs shows significant deviations from the pre-change data.  
    * `net_send_packet`, `diskio`, `memory_usage`, `istio_count`, and `istio_duration` all show increased values, indicating higher resource consumption and potential bottlenecks.

* **Impact Assessment:** The changes in these KPIs likely lead to performance degradation, increased error rates, and potentially decreased system availability.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because several KPIs show significant deviations from their historical norms. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The selected KPIs are experiencing the most drastic changes, suggesting they are central to the performance issues.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the abnormal increases and decreases in key performance indicators, pointing to a potential failure.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution emphasizes a systematic approach to troubleshooting:
    * **Code Review:** Examine the changes made to pinpoint the source of the issue.
    * **Log and Monitoring Analysis:**  Deep dive into logs and system monitoring data to gain a clearer understanding of the behavior.
    * **Reversal or Mitigation:** Depending on the findings, consider reverting the changes or implementing strategies to address the performance problems.
