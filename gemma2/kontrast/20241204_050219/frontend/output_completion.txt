}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** The significant drops in `istio_success_rate` and increases in `istio_duration` strongly suggest a failure. The other KPIs also show concerning changes.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the KPIs that most directly indicate a problem.
* **Reason:** The analysis explains the observed KPI changes and connects them to potential problems with communication and processing.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on troubleshooting the Istio and frontend service configurations and monitoring the situation closely.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the substantial negative impact on KPIs like 'istio_success_rate', 'istio_count', and 'istio_duration', coupled with the increased variability in 'net_send_packet' and decreased 'memory_usage'.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs were chosen based on the magnitude and direction of the changes. The significant drop in 'istio_success_rate' points to potential communication issues within the system.

* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the inconsistency in the system's performance after the change. The drop in success rate, coupled with the fluctuations in other metrics, suggests a problem with the implemented changes.

* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging the problematic code changes and analyzing the logs for more specific insights into the failure.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_success_rate, istio_duration, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet, istio_count",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs like 'istio_success_rate' and 'istio_duration' indicate a failure. The 'net_recv_packet', 'net_send_packet', and 'istio_count' also show unusual changes, suggesting communication or processing issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the logs and system configurations related to Istio and the frontend service.  Focus on understanding the cause of the 'istio_success_rate' decrease and the large increase in 'istio_duration'. Monitor the affected KPIs closely and consider rolling back the change if the issue persists."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** The  significant drops in 'istio_success_rate', large increase in 'istio_duration', and unusual changes in network-related KPIs strongly point to a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the most impactful KPIs showing clear deviations from normal behavior.
* **Reason:** The analysis explains the observed changes in KPIs and their potential implications for the frontend service's functionality.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on investigating the Istio-related issues and monitoring the situation closely.  Rolling back the change is a viable option if the problem cannot be resolved quickly.
