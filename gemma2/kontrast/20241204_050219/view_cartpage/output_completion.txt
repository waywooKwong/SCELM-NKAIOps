**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the explicitly stated anomaly "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" directly points to a problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "Wrong IP Address-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" - This is the primary anomaly driving the classification.
* **Reason:** The anomaly description clearly indicates a failure in the change.  
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on debugging and fixing the root cause of the IP address and software configuration issues.

``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "normal" because the provided data doesn't show a clear pattern of failure. 
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "N/A"  Since the change type is "normal", there are no top 5 abnormal KPIs to list.
* **Reason:** The analysis points out anomalies flagged by the SCWARN algorithm, but the KPIs themselves don't show significant deviations. The data ranges remain consistent before and after the change.
* **Solution:** "N/A"  No solution is needed as the change is not classified as a failure.
