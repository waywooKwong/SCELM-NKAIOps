**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a successful change implementation. Here's why:

* **No Significant KPI Deviations:**  Key metrics like `request_count` and `request_success_rate` show changes in range and trend, but these are not considered significant deviations from historical norms.
* **Absence of Anomalies:** The system's anomaly detection algorithms (SCWARN) did not flag any unusual patterns or spikes in the monitored KPIs.

Therefore, based on the available data, the change can be classified as "normal."

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Normal**:  The data doesn't show clear signs of failure. There are no significant KPI degradations or identified anomalies that point to a problematic change. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs**: This section is left blank as there were no reported abnormal KPIs.
* **Reason:** The provided metrics suggest the change didn't disrupt system performance. Minor fluctuations in ranges could be due to normal operational variations and don't necessarily indicate a failure.
* **Solution**:  Since the change appears to be normal, no immediate solution is required.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Normal:**  The analysis states that the data doesn't show significant deviations from normal KPIs. The shift in trends for 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' is not considered outside expected operational ranges.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:**  Not applicable as no abnormal KPIs are identified within the provided data.
* **Reason:** The analysis emphasizes that despite trend shifts, the overall KPI values remain within acceptable boundaries. There are no indications of system disruption or performance degradation.

* **Solution:** Not applicable since the change is classified as normal.

	"solution": ""
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

Based on the information provided:

* **Pre-Approved Process Adherence:** The text doesn't mention anything about a pre-approved process, so we can't definitively say if it was followed.
* **Post-Change Metrics Comparison:**  The data shows changes in `request_count` and `request_success_rate` but doesn't state that these changes are outside of acceptable historical norms. We need more context about the expected ranges for these KPIs. 
* **Impact Assessment:** The analysis states that KPIs remain within historical norms, and no significant degradation in system performance is reported.  The 'SCWARN' algorithm didn't flag any anomalies. 
* **Anomaly Detection:** The text explicitly says "Total anomalies found: -1" and "Total number of anomalous kpis: 0". This means the monitoring system did not detect any abnormalities.



Since the data doesn't provide clear evidence of significant KPI deviations or anomalies, the change can be classified as **normal**.

Analyze logs around the identified anomaly timestamps (11:20:00, 12:12:00, 21:14:00, 21:26:00) to pinpoint the root cause of the increased request count and decreased success rate.  Review application performance monitoring tools for further insights into resource utilization and bottlenecks. Consider rolling back the change or implementing temporary mitigation strategies until the issue is resolved."

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate'.  The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration.  'request_count' shows a wider range after the change, and 'request_success_rate' also shows a wider range after the change. This suggests a problem with the service's performance or configuration.",
	"solution": "1. **Review recent code changes:** Carefully examine the code modifications made before the data shift. Look for potential bugs, incorrect configurations, or unintended side effects. \n2. **Compare logs before and after the change:** Analyze system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the data anomalies. \n3. **Investigate the 'SCWARN algorithm' triggers:** Understand why the SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies at specific timestamps (e.g., 2024-10-07 03:02:00, 2024-10-07 06:52:00, 2024-10-07 19:58:00). This may provide clues about the root cause. \n4. **Monitor the service closely:** Continue to monitor 'request_count' and 'request_success_rate' after implementing any changes to identify if the issue persists or recurs."
}
```


**Explanation of the Classification:**

The classification is set to "failure" because:

* **Significant KPI Shift:** Both `request_count` and `request_success_rate` exhibit drastic changes in their data ranges after the change. This indicates a significant deviation from the expected behavior.
* **SCWARN Anomalies:** The SCWARN algorithm, which likely uses predefined thresholds and patterns to detect anomalies, flagged specific timestamps where the KPIs deviated significantly.

These factors strongly suggest that the change introduced a problem impacting the service's performance.



**Importance of Further Investigation:**


While the classification points to "failure," further investigation is crucial:

* **Root Cause:** Determine the exact reason behind the KPI shifts. Is it due to code bugs, configuration errors, external dependencies, or something else?
* **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate how the performance degradation affects users or the overall system. 


By thoroughly investigating the issue and implementing appropriate solutions, you can restore the service to its expected performance level.
