``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  Set to "failure" because the provided KPI data shows substantial shifts after the change, pointing towards a negative impact.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These are the KPIs that show the most significant deviations from their expected behavior. 

    * `memory_usage`, `cpu_usage`, and `diskio` all have much larger ranges and potentially higher values than before the change, suggesting resource overload.
    * `istio_count` and `istio_duration`  also show increases, possibly indicating increased traffic or issues within the Istio service mesh.

* **Reason:** A clear statement explaining why the change is classified as a failure based on the KPI data. 

* **Solution:**  General steps to address the identified issues. This could be further refined with more specific troubleshooting actions once the root cause is determined.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration, istio_count, diskio",

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type**: "failure" because the KPI changes point to a negative impact.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  The list includes the most concerning KPIs with significant shifts:
    * `memory_usage`: Increased substantially.
    * `cpu_usage`: Increased significantly.
    * `istio_duration`: A large increase suggests network communication bottlenecks.
    * `istio_count`: More requests passing through Istio, potentially indicating increased load.
    * `diskio`: Dropped to zero, which is unusual and might signal a problem with data access.
* **reason**:  The explanation highlights the key observations: resource consumption spikes, and potential issues related to network performance and disk access.
* **solution**: The suggested steps are aimed at troubleshooting:

    1. **Code Review:** Examine recent changes for potential causes of increased resource usage.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Look for errors or warnings related to the affected KPIs.
    3. **Resource Tuning:**  Adjust application settings to better manage memory, CPU, and network resources.
    4. **Performance Optimization:** Identify and address bottlenecks in the application's code.

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "memory_usage, cpu_usage, istio_duration, diskio, istio_count",
	"reason": "There are significant changes in several key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. Memory usage decreased, CPU usage increased, and both istio_duration and istio_count showed notable upward trends. Disk IO also experienced a shift towards higher values. These deviations suggest potential resource strain or performance issues.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of these KPI changes. This could involve reviewing logs, monitoring application behavior, and analyzing system resource utilization. Consider optimizing resource allocation, identifying performance bottlenecks, and adjusting configuration settings to mitigate the observed issues."

	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "cpu_usage, istio_duration, memory_usage, diskio, istio_count",
	"reason": "The system exhibits significant changes in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change. CPU usage drops drastically, while istio_duration shows a large increase, indicating potential bottlenecks or increased latency in service communication. Memory usage also decreases, which could suggest resource reallocation issues. DiskIO usage becomes extremely low, potentially signaling a problem with data access or processing. Lastly, istio_count increases, hinting at more frequent interactions within the Istio mesh.",
	"solution": "Investigate the root cause of the changes in CPU usage, istio_duration, memory usage, diskIO and istio_count. Analyze logs and system metrics to pinpoint the source of the issues. Review recent code deployments or configuration changes that might have contributed to these performance anomalies.  Consider optimizing resource allocation, troubleshooting network communication bottlenecks, and examining potential data access/processing problems."
