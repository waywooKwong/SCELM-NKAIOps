	"reason": "The provided data indicates that the change did not result in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs). While there are slight variations in some metrics, they fall within acceptable ranges and do not suggest a major performance degradation. The SCWARN algorithm also did not flag any critical anomalies. ",
	"solution": ""
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

Based on the data provided, the change appears to be normal. Here's why:

* **No Critical Anomalies:** The SCWARN algorithm didn't identify any critical anomalies during the change period. This suggests that the system's behavior remained largely within expected bounds.
* **Minor KPI Variations:** While there are some variations in metrics like `request_count` and `request_success_rate`, these variations are relatively minor and fall within acceptable ranges. The overall trends for these KPIs are also consistent with previous patterns.

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:** "failure" because the SCWARN algorithm detected anomalies, suggesting the change deviated from expected behavior.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** "request_count, request_success_rate". These are the primary KPIs showing anomalies.
* **Reason:** The analysis highlights the discrepancy between pre-change and post-change KPI behavior. While not a catastrophic failure, the anomalies warrant further investigation.
* **Solution:** Suggests deeper analysis through log review and historical data comparison to pinpoint the cause of these anomalies.
