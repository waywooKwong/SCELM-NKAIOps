}
``` 


Let me break down why I classified this change as a "failure":

* **Decreased Request Success Rate:** A drop in 'request_success_rate' is a clear indicator that the system is struggling to handle requests successfully. This suggests there might be errors in the code or configuration.
* **Shifted Request Count Distribution:** Changes in the distribution of 'request_count' can point to unexpected behavior. It could mean certain types of requests are now more common or less frequent, which could also indicate a bug or unintended consequence of the changes. 
* **SCWARN Algorithm Anomalies:** The fact that the SCWARN algorithm flagged anomalies reinforces the suspicion that something is wrong. These algorithms are designed to detect unusual patterns in data, so their alerts should be taken seriously.

**Important Note:**  While these indicators strongly suggest a failure, further investigation is crucial. Analyzing logs and working with developers will help pinpoint the exact cause of the problem and develop an effective solution.

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided data, the change appears to be normal. Here's why:

* **KPI Stability:** The key performance indicators (KPIs) like 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' show minor fluctuations but remain within their historical ranges. This indicates the change did not significantly impact system performance.
* **No Significant Anomalies:**  The monitoring system didn't flag any major anomalies or deviations from expected behavior patterns. The identified anomalies are limited to single spikes and dips, which are considered transient and do not necessarily point to a problem.
* **Data Ranges:** Comparing the data ranges before and after the change shows minimal differences, further supporting the conclusion that the change did not cause significant disruptions.

Let me break down why this change is classified as 'normal':

* **KPI Stability:**  The metrics `request_success_rate` and `request_count` show minor variations but remain within their historical ranges. 
* **Absence of Major Anomalies:** The data clearly states "Total anomalies found: -1" and "Total number of anomalous kpis: 0". This means no significant deviations from expected behavior were flagged by the monitoring system.

While there are some fluctuations, these appear to be within normal operational bounds and don't indicate a failure.

}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure:** The data clearly shows a decline in crucial KPIs like 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' after the change. This, coupled with SCWARN alerts, strongly suggests the change introduced a problem.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The most significant indicators are 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'. These directly reflect the system's ability to process requests successfully.

* **Reason:** The decline in these KPIs points to a malfunction caused by the recent changes. The SCWARN alerts further confirm that abnormal behavior is occurring, requiring immediate attention.
* **Solution:**  The solution focuses on:
    * **Reverting:** Quickly undo the changes to restore the system's previous stable state.
    * **Code Review:** Meticulously examine the code modifications for any errors or unintended consequences.
    * **Log Analysis:** Investigate system logs and error messages for clues about the root cause of the problem.
    * **Database Performance:** Ensure database queries are efficient and indexed properly to avoid performance bottlenecks.
    * **Staging Environment Testing:** Before implementing fixes, rigorously test them in a controlled environment to prevent further issues.

	"change_type": "failure",

	"reason": "The change resulted in significant anomalies in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'.  The 'request_success_rate' KPI dropped significantly after the change, indicating a potential failure in processing requests. Similarly, 'request_count' also showed a notable shift in its trend, suggesting a disruption in request handling.",
	"solution": "1. **Rollback the recent changes:** Immediately revert the changes to restore the previous state and assess the impact. \n2. **Thoroughly review the code changes:** Carefully examine the modifications made before the data shift, looking for potential bugs, misconfigurations, or unintended side effects. \n3. **Analyze system logs:** Investigate logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual activity coinciding with the KPI deviations. \n4. **Monitor affected KPIs closely:** Continuously track the performance of the anomalous KPIs to identify patterns or further deviations. \n5. **Engage with relevant stakeholders:** Collaborate with developers, system administrators, and other relevant parties to diagnose the root cause and implement a solution."
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The data provided indicates a clear deviation in key performance indicators ("request_success_rate" and "request_count") after the change was implemented. This suggests that the change likely introduced a problem affecting the system's ability to process requests successfully.

	"reason": "The change resulted in a significant decrease in 'request_success_rate' and a shift in the trend of 'request_count'.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear failure:

* **Decreased `request_success_rate`**:  This is a critical indicator of a problem. Requests are failing more frequently after the change, suggesting an issue with how the service processes them.
* **Shifted Trend in `request_count`**: While the overall count might not have drastically changed, the trend has shifted. This could indicate that the change is affecting how many requests are being processed or handled efficiently.
* **SCWARN Algorithm Flagging Anomalies**: The fact that a system designed to detect anomalies has triggered an alert strongly suggests that something went wrong with the implementation.

{
	"change_type": "normal",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "None",
	"reason": "The change did not result in any significant deviations in KPIs. All indicator data remained within historical thresholds and no anomalies were flagged by the monitoring system. The 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' KPIs showed minor fluctuations but remained within acceptable ranges.",
	"solution": "None"
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates that the change did not cause any significant performance issues.  

* **No Anomalies Detected:** The monitoring system didn't flag any anomalies, suggesting the change behaved as expected.
* **KPI Within Acceptable Ranges:** While there were minor fluctuations in 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count', these remained within historical norms.
