**Explanation:**

The provided data clearly indicates a failure:

* **request_success_rate dropped to 0**: This means requests are no longer being successfully processed. 
* **request_count showed a significant shift**:  While this could be normal fluctuation, the combination with a 0 success rate suggests a problem with request handling.

{
	"change_type": "failure",
	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "request_success_rate, request_count", 
	"reason": "The metrics 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count'  show significant deviations after the change. 'request_success_rate' dropped to 0.0 from a previous range of [-1.7184,3.5214], indicating a potential failure in service delivery. 'request_count' also fluctuated dramatically,  jumping from a stable state to a wide range of [-1.7192,3.5111]. This suggests instability and unexpected behavior.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes introduced during this deployment to pinpoint the root cause of these anomalies. Review logs for error messages or warnings that might provide further clues. Roll back the change if necessary until the issue is resolved." 
}
```



**Explanation:**

* **Change Type: Failure**  The metrics clearly indicate a negative impact after the change. The drop in 'request_success_rate' to 0.0 and the significant fluctuation in 'request_count' strongly suggest a failure.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** We list 'request_success_rate' and 'request_count' as the primary culprits due to their substantial deviations from expected behavior.  
* **Reason:** The provided data directly supports a classification of "failure." The metrics demonstrate a clear pattern of degradation in performance following the change.
* **Solution:** A systematic approach is needed:
    1. **Code Review:** Examine the recent code changes for potential bugs or unintended consequences that might be causing these issues.
    2. **Log Analysis:** Carefully review system logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual patterns of activity that occurred around the time of the change.
    3. **Rollback:** If the issue is severe and impacting users, consider rolling back the recent changes to restore the previous stable state.

	"reason": "The change resulted in a complete failure of request processing as indicated by the 'request_success_rate' dropping to 0.  'request_count' also exhibits unusual fluctuations and dips, suggesting instability in request handling.

}
``` 



**Explanation of the "failure" classification:**

* **request_success_rate dropping to 0:** This is a clear indication of a catastrophic failure.  No requests are being successfully processed, which indicates a major problem with the application's logic or infrastructure.
* **Fluctuations and dips in 'request_count':** While not as severe as the 0 success rate, these fluctuations suggest instability in how the system handles requests. It could be caused by issues like resource contention, slow response times, or errors during processing.
* **SCWARN anomalies:** The fact that the SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies at specific points in time further strengthens the case for a failure.

The combination of these factors strongly suggests that the recent changes introduced a bug or issue that is causing the system to fail.

**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a significant change in the behavior of two key KPIs: `request_success_rate` and `request_count`.  These shifts are not consistent with typical trends and suggest a potential failure.

Here's why this is classified as a "failure":

* **Drastic Data Range Shifts:** The data ranges for both KPIs have changed dramatically after the change. This suggests a fundamental alteration in how the system is operating.
* **Trend Reversals:**  The overall trends for both KPIs reversed, which is highly unusual without a significant event or configuration change.

    * Implement continuous monitoring to prevent future occurrences.

**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The drastic drop in `request_success_rate` to 0 and the significant shift in `request_count` clearly indicate a failure.

* **Top 5 abnormal kpi**:  We list the two most critical KPIs affected: `request_count` and `request_success_rate`.

* **reason**: The reason is clearly stated based on the KPI changes, pointing to a problem with request processing and handling.

* **solution**: The solution steps provide a structured approach to addressing the failure: rollback, code review, log analysis, and continuous monitoring.
