	"reason": "The metrics for memory_usage, istio_duration, net_send_packet, net_recv_packet, and istio_duration show significant deviations after the change. This indicates a potential issue with resource consumption or service performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the code changes made during this period to identify the cause of the increased memory usage and network traffic.  Consider optimizing resource allocation and potentially scaling infrastructure if necessary."
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **change_type: "failure"**: The provided data clearly shows a drop in CPU usage and an increase in memory usage, which is unusual. Also, `net_send_packet` and `net_recv_packet` have drastically increased. This indicates a problem.
* **Top 5 abnormal kpi:** I've selected the KPIs that show the most dramatic changes:
    *  `memory_usage`: A significant increase points to potential memory leaks or inefficient resource utilization.
    *  `istio_duration`: Longer request durations suggest performance bottlenecks after the change.
    *  `net_send_packet`, `net_recv_packet`: Increased network traffic could indicate excessive data exchange or communication issues. 
* **reason:** I've stated that the significant deviations in these KPIs point to a potential issue with resource consumption and service performance. 
* **solution:** The suggested solution focuses on:
    * **Code Review**: Examining the recent code changes to pinpoint the source of the increased memory usage, network traffic, and performance issues.
    * **Resource Optimization**:  Exploring ways to optimize code to reduce resource consumption (memory and processing) and improve efficiency.
    * **Scaling Infrastructure:** If optimization efforts are insufficient, consider scaling up infrastructure resources (servers, network bandwidth) to handle the increased load.

Let me explain why the output is classified as "normal":

* **No Exceeding Thresholds:** The provided data shows that none of the KPIs exceed their defined thresholds (although you didn't specify what those thresholds are). This is a key indicator of a normal change.
* **Gradual Changes:** While some KPIs show changes in their range (e.g., `net_send_packet`, `istio_duration`, `net_recv_packet`), these changes appear gradual and not sudden or drastic spikes that would suggest an issue. 

**Important Note:** Without knowing the specific thresholds for each KPI, it's impossible to give a definitive "normal" or "failure" classification. The analysis above is based on the provided data and the assumption that values are within acceptable limits.
