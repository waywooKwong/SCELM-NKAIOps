**Explanation:**

The provided data indicates a clear deviation in key performance indicators (KPIs) after the change was implemented. The shifts in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' suggest a disruption in the system's normal operation.  

Here's a breakdown of why this points to a failure:

* **Sudden Shifts:** The drastic changes in data ranges for both KPIs point to a sudden, unexpected event rather than gradual fluctuations.
* **Trend Reversals:** The reversal of trends (from down to up for 'request_duration' and from up to down for 'request_count') further highlights the abnormal nature of the change.

**Recommendations:**


The proposed solutions focus on identifying the root cause of the issue and restoring normal system behavior:



* **Code Review:** This is crucial to pinpoint any bugs or misconfigurations introduced by the recent changes.
* **Log Analysis:** System logs can provide valuable clues about errors, warnings, or unusual events that occurred around the time of the change.
* **Incident Investigation:** The "Deleting White List" incident mentioned warrants further investigation as it could be directly related to the observed anomalies.



* **Resource Monitoring:** 


Excessive CPU usage, memory consumption, or network traffic could indicate a resource bottleneck causing performance issues.
* **Rollback:** If possible, reverting the recent changes is a quick way to restore stability while investigations continue.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Data Shift:** The provided data shows a dramatic shift in the ranges of "request_duration" and "request_count" after the change. This indicates something significant has occurred that is affecting how the system processes requests.
* **Directionality:** The increase in "request_duration" suggests requests are taking longer to complete, which is a clear sign of performance degradation.  The decrease in "request_count" could be due to errors or the system becoming overloaded and rejecting requests.

**Important Note:** While the data strongly points to a failure, without more context about the specific change made and the expected behavior, it's impossible to definitively pinpoint the cause. The suggested solutions aim to investigate further and resolve the issue.

**Explanation:**

Based on the data provided,  the following conclusions can be made:

1. **Pre-Approved Process Adherence:**  While the text doesn't explicitly state if a pre-approved process was followed, it focuses on metric analysis, implying a structured approach.
2. **Post-Change Metrics Comparison:** The metrics "request_duration" and "request_count" show changes in their ranges after the change. However, these changes don't necessarily indicate a failure.  The text states the data remains within established thresholds. 
3. **Impact Assessment:** 
    * No significant degradation in system performance is mentioned. 
4. **Anomaly Detection:** The SCWARN algorithm identified anomalies, but the analysis doesn't classify them as severe or impactful on overall service performance.


Since the KPIs remain within acceptable ranges and there's no indication of a major system impact despite some metric fluctuations, classifying this change as "normal" is justified.

**Explanation of the Analysis:**

* **Change Type:** Classified as "failure" due to the significant deviations in 'request_duration' and 'request_count' after the change. These shifts indicate a problem with the service's performance. 
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** The most critical anomalies are 'request_duration' and 'request_count'.  'request_duration' showing increased maximum values and a shift in trend from decreasing to increasing suggests processing delays or bottlenecks. 'request_count' showing decreased minimum and maximum values with a trend shift indicates fewer requests being handled, possibly due to errors or service unavailability.
* **Reason:** The primary reason is likely the "Deleting White List by Mistake-Configuration Errors-Defective Software Changes" incident. This suggests a misconfiguration that negatively impacted the service's ability to process requests efficiently.
* **Solution:** 
    1. Review recent code changes for potential bugs introduced during the change.
    2. Analyze logs for error messages or unusual activity around the time of the anomaly.
    3. Investigate the "Deleting White List" incident thoroughly and identify its impact on the service.  
    4. Monitor system resources to rule out resource constraints as a contributing factor. 
    5. Consider rolling back recent changes if possible to restore previous functionality while further investigation is conducted.

**Explanation of the Analysis:**

* **Data Range Shifts:** The most significant indicator of failure is the drastic change in data ranges for 'request_duration' and 'request_count'. These shifts suggest that the system is behaving differently, possibly due to a bug or misconfiguration.

* **Trend Changes:**  The 'request_duration' now shows an upward trend, while 'request_count' shows a downward trend. This indicates a potential change in how the system handles requests and processes them. 

* **Potential Causes:**
    * **Code Errors:** The recent code changes could have introduced bugs that are causing these anomalies.
    * **Configuration Issues:**  A misconfiguration in settings or parameters related to request handling might be responsible for the changes in behavior.

The data ranges for these KPIs have shifted drastically after the change, indicating a potential malfunction or misconfiguration. 'request_duration' now shows a much wider range with values exceeding 26 seconds, while 'request_count' has decreased significantly.

}
``` 

**Explanation:**


* **Change Type: Failure:**  The drastic shift in 'request_duration' (up to 26 seconds) and the significant decrease in 'request_count' strongly indicate a failure. These changes suggest the service is struggling to handle requests efficiently.

* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  'request_duration' and 'request_count' are the most impactful KPIs affected by the change, hence they are listed.

* **Reason:** The provided data clearly shows a performance degradation after the change. The specific action of "Deleting user accounts" needs further investigation as it might be directly or indirectly related to the issue. 

* **Solution:**
    * Code Review:  Essential to find any bugs introduced by recent changes.
    * Log Analysis:  Can pinpoint errors or events occurring around the time of the anomalies.
    * Investigating 'Deleting User Accounts': This action warrants special attention as it could have unintended consequences on system performance. 
    * Resource Monitoring:  Check if resource limitations are causing the slowdown.
    * Continuous Monitoring: Essential to ensure the implemented solutions resolve the issue and prevent future occurrences.

Let me explain why I classified this as a "failure" based on the provided information:

* **Drastic Shifts in KPI Ranges:** The ranges for both `request_duration` and `request_count` have changed dramatically after the modification. This indicates a significant deviation from the expected behavior, suggesting a problem with the implementation.
* **Increase in Request Duration:** A higher `request_duration` usually implies slower response times, which negatively affects user experience and system performance.
* **Decrease in Request Count:**  A lower `request_count` could be due to various reasons, but it's worth investigating whether the change inadvertently caused the system to handle fewer requests or if there are errors preventing successful requests. 

**Important Note:** Without access to the actual code changes and more detailed logs, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure. The suggested solutions provide a general framework for troubleshooting and resolving this issue.

}
``` 


**Explanation:**

Based on the information provided, the change appears to be normal. Here's why:

* **No significant KPI deviations:** The metrics `request_duration` and `request_count` show fluctuations within expected ranges before and after the change. There are no major increases or decreases that would indicate a problem.
* **Anomaly detection:** The SCWARN algorithm didn't identify any anomalies during the analysis period. This suggests that the system behaved as expected after the change.
