	"Top 5 abnormal kpi": "istio_count, istio_duration, istio_success_rate, net_recv_packet, net_send_packet",
	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change.  'istio_count' shows an upward trend, 'istio_duration'  increased, 'istio_success_rate'  decreased, and 'net_recv_packet' and 'net_send_packet'  exhibit abnormal fluctuations. These indicate potential issues with network communication and service performance.",
	"solution": "Investigate the logs and system configurations related to Istio and network communication. Review the specific changes made to identify the root cause of the anomalies. Consider rolling back the change or implementing mitigating measures to restore normal KPI values."

Analyze the impact of the change on resource utilization (cpu_usage, diskio) and potentially adjust system parameters or scaling to address resource contention.
