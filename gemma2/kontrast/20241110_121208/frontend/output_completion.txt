**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:** These KPIs exhibit the most significant deviations from their pre-change behavior, suggesting they are most affected by the software changes.
* **Reason:** The analysis points to potential resource contention as the primary cause. The increased ranges and shifted trends in the selected KPIs indicate that the system is struggling to handle the increased load or that the changes have introduced inefficiencies.
* **Solution:** The suggested solution focuses on identifying the root cause of the problem within the code changes and then implementing appropriate mitigation strategies.

	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  'istio_success_rate' dropped sharply, 'istio_count' showed a downward trend, 'net_send_packet' decreased, 'istio_duration' increased, and 'memory_usage' experienced a shift. These anomalies suggest potential issues with service communication, resource utilization, and overall system performance.",

	"reason": "Significant deviations in KPIs after the change indicate a failure. istio_success_rate dropped drastically, net_send_packet and istio_duration show increased variability, cpu_usage and memory_usage also exhibit unusual patterns.  The newly generated log pattern further suggests a problem.",

Review logs for detailed error messages and correlate them with the anomalous KPIs.  Consider reverting the changes or implementing a rollback strategy.  Monitor the system closely after implementing any solution and ensure KPIs return to normal ranges."

Optimize 'istio_duration' by analyzing latency bottlenecks and improving service communication.
