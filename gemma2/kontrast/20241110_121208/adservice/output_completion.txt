	"reason": "Significant deviations in key performance indicators (KPIs) were observed after the change.  istio_duration and istio_success_rate show increased values and decreased success rates respectively, indicating potential performance bottlenecks or issues with request handling. cpu_usage and memory_usage show fluctuations, suggesting resource contention. net_send_packet also shows a slight increase, indicating potential network load changes.",

**Explanation:**

* **Change Type:**  "failure" because the KPIs show clear negative changes after the change.
* **Top 5 Abnormal KPIs:**  The KPIs with the most significant deviations are:
    * `istio_duration`: Increased duration suggests requests are taking longer to process.
    * `istio_success_rate`: Decreased success rate indicates more failed requests.
    * `cpu_usage`: Fluctuations suggest the system is struggling with CPU load.
    * `memory_usage`:  Fluctuations point to potential memory issues.
    * `net_send_packet`: Increased packet sending could indicate network strain.
* **Reason:** The combination of these KPIs suggests that the software changes introduced problems with performance, resource utilization, and possibly request handling.
* **Solution:** The recommended steps are:
    * **Root Cause Analysis:** Carefully examine the code changes to pinpoint the source of the issues.
    * **Log and Monitoring Review:** Analyze system logs and monitoring data for more detailed insights into the problems.
    * **Rollback or Mitigation:** Consider reverting the problematic changes or implementing solutions to address resource contention, performance bottlenecks, and network load.
