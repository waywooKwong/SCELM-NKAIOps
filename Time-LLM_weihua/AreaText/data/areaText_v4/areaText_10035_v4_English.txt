      Among them, type [Level shift down] remained abnormal, timestamps are: 2023-11-27 16:52:00, 2023-11-27 17:08:00, 2023-11-27 17:10:00, 2023-11-27 17:12:00, 2023-11-27 17:16:00, 2023-11-27 17:18:00, 2023-11-27 17:24:00
Total anomalies found: 561
Total number of anomalous kpis: 37
Total number of anomaly description shapes: 3

These are definitions for anomaly types (patterns):
        Anomaly description shapes are divided into two major categories: Still in abnormal state and Recover to normal state,
        Still in abnormal state, these anomalies remain in an abnormal state after appearing at the anomaly point
        1. Sudden increase
        2. Sudden decrease
        3. Level shift up
        4. Level shift down
        5. Steady increase
        6. Steady decrease
        Recover to normal state, these anomalies return to normal state after appearing at the anomaly point
        7. Single spike
        8. Single dip
        9. Transient level shift up
        10. Transient level shift down
        11. Multiple spikes
        12. Multiple dips
        13. Fluctuations

Please analyze the above domain text and kpi anomaly situations, and provide your judgment: Expected change or failed change
Also provide your thoughts and reasoning. If it's a failed change, please provide your suggested solution
Please answer in the following format:{(
 "change_type":"Please return expected change or failed change,"
 "reason":"Your reason for the change_type field",
 "solution":"None if this is an expected change or solution")}
