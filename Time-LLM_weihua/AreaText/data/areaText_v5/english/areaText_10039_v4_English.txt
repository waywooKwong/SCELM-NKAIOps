Analysis of kpi changes related to the service:

SCWARN algorithm identifies anomalies at the following timestamps:
    1, 2023-11-28 13:10:00
    2, 2023-11-28 13:16:00
    3, 2023-11-28 13:30:00
    4, 2023-11-28 13:36:00
    5, 2023-11-28 13:44:00
    6, 2023-11-28 13:50:00
    7, 2023-11-28 13:56:00

These are definitions for anomaly types (patterns):
    Anomaly description shapes are divided into two major categories: Still in abnormal state and Recover to normal state,
    Still in abnormal state, these anomalies remain in an abnormal state after appearing at the anomaly point
    1. Sudden increase
    2. Sudden decrease
    3. Level shift up
    4. Level shift down
    5. Steady increase
    6. Steady decrease
    Recover to normal state, these anomalies return to normal state after appearing at the anomaly point
    7. Single spike
    8. Single dip
    9. Transient level shift up
    10. Transient level shift down
    11. Multiple spikes
    12. Multiple dips
    13. Fluctuations

Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies (single kpi anomalies not related to overall anomalies are not output):

Analysis of kpi changes related to the service:

SCWARN algorithm identifies anomalies at the following timestamps:
    1, 2023-11-28 13:10:00
    2, 2023-11-28 13:16:00
    3, 2023-11-28 13:30:00

    6, 2023-11-28 13:50:00
    7, 2023-11-28 13:56:00

These are definitions for anomaly types (patterns):
    Anomaly description shapes are divided into two major categories: Still in abnormal state and Recover to normal state,
    Still in abnormal state, these anomalies remain in an abnormal state after appearing at the anomaly point
    1. Sudden increase
    2. Sudden decrease
    3. Level shift up
    4. Level shift down
    5. Steady increase
    6. Steady decrease
    Recover to normal state, these anomalies return to normal state after appearing at the anomaly point
    7. Single spike
    8. Single dip
    9. Transient level shift up
    10. Transient level shift down
    11. Multiple spikes
    12. Multiple dips
    13. Fluctuations

Types of single kpi anomalies related to overall anomalies (single kpi anomalies not related to overall anomalies are not output):
